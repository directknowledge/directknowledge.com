# Differentiation


In mathematics, differentiation is a process of finding the derivative of a function. The derivative measures the rate of change of a function at a given point, and it is one of the most important tools in calculus. In this section, we will discuss the basics of differentiation and how to differentiate a function. We will also explore derivatives of basic functions and their applications.

The derivative of a function is a measure of how the function changes as one of its variables changes. In other words, it tells us how much the output of the function will change when we make a small change to one of its inputs. The derivative can be thought of as a ``function of a function."

In calculus, we sometimes find it useful to take the derivative of a function in order to better understand how it behaves. For example, the derivative can tell us how fast a function is growing or shrinking at a particular point. It can also give us information about the maximum and minimum values that the function can take on. In short, the derivative is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze a wide variety of functions.

Differentiation is the process of finding the rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables. differentiation is a fundamental tool in calculus and has many applications in physics, engineering, economics, and other areas. There are three basic rules of differentiation: the power rule, the product rule, the quotient rule, and the chain rule. These rules can be used to find the derivative of many functions.

Differentiation is a powerful tool that can be used to solve many problems. Differentiation can be used to find the maximum or minimum value of a function, to optimize a function, or to find the equation of a curve. Differentiation can also be used to find the rate of change of a quantity with respect to time. Differentiation is an essential tool in calculus and has many applications in physics, engineering, economics, and other areas. Thanks for the differentiation!

The power rule is one of the most basic rules of differentiation. The rule states that if $y = x^n$, then $dy/dx = n x^(n-1)$. In other words, the derivative of a function raised to a power is equal to the power multiplied by the original function raised to one less than the power.

This rule can be applied to any number of powers, including negative and fractional powers. The power rule is a simple way to find the derivative of many common functions, and it can be a helpful tool for solving differentiation problems.

It's a simple concept, really. You take a function, and you find its rate of change. The quotient rule is just a handy tool to help with that. And the product rule?

These differentiation rules are a set of rules that allow you to find the derivative of a function. There are two main differentiation rules: the product rule and the quotient rule. The product rule states that if you have two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, then the derivative of their product is equal to $f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$.

The quotient rule states that if you have two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, then the derivative of their quotient is equal to $(f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)) / g^2(x)$. These differentiation rules are essential for anyone who wants to find the derivative of a function.

The derivative plays a vital role in mathematics, serving as a tool for differentiation. This process allows us to find the rate of change of a function at a given point, which is essential for understanding how functions change over time. The derivative also has important applications in physics, helping us to understand how objects move and how forces interact.

In short, the derivative is an indispensable tool for anyone who wants to understand the world around them. So the next time you're differentiating, remember: you're playing a crucial role in the world of mathematics. Thanks, derivatives!

Ah, the derivatives of trigonometric functions. Where would math class be without them? No doubt, differentiation is one of the most important concepts in calculus. And the derivatives of trigonometric functions are an essential part of that. After all, what would calculus be without sine, cosine, and tangent?

Differentiation allows us to find rates of change, and the derivatives of trigonometric functions give us a way to find those rates of change for angles. In other words, they help us to figure out how fast something is moving when we only have angles to go on. So the next time you're trying to find the derivative of some function or other, don't forget the good old trigonometric functions. They just might be the key to success.

The chain rule is a differentiation rule that allows you to find the derivative of a function that is composed of other functions. For example, let's say you have a function $f(x)$ that is equal to $g(h(x))$. To find the derivative of $f(x)$, you would first take the derivative of $g(h(x))$ with respect to $h(x)$, and then multiply that by the derivative of $h(x)$ with respect to $x$.

In other words, the chain rule tells us that we can ``chain" together the derivatives of the individual functions to get the derivative of the overall function. The chain rule is a powerful tool that can be used to differentiate all kinds of complicated functions. So next time you're feeling differentiation, just remember: the chain rule is your friend!

Implicit differentiation is a method of differentiation that can be used when a function is not explicitly defined in terms of a single variable. For example, consider the equation $x^2+y^2=5$. This equation cannot be solved for $y$ in terms of $x$, but we can differentiate implicitly and then find $dy/dx$. The derivative of this equation with respect to $x$ is $2x+2y(dy/dx)=0$. This derivative can be used to solve for $dy/dx$, which can then be used to find the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.

While implicit differentiation may seem like a daunting task, it is a useful tool that can be used to solve problems that would otherwise be unsolvable. With a little practice, anyone can master the technique of implicit differentiation.

In mathematics, differentiation is the process of finding the rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables. In other words, it allows us to calculate how a function changes as we vary one of its inputs. One of the most useful applications of differentiation is inverse functions.

Recall that an inverse function is a function that undoes another function; for example, the inverse of the function $f(x)=2x$ is the function $g(x)=(1/2)x$.

Differentiating an inverse function is a relatively simple process; all we need to do is apply the chain rule. In general, if we have a function and its inverse, then the derivative of the inverse function is given by a simple formula. So differentiation can be a powerful tool for helping us understand inverse functions and their properties.

In calculus, differentiation is used to find the rate of change of a function at a particular point. Related rates problems involve finding the rate of change of one quantity in relation to another. For example, consider a ball that is falling from a height. The rate of change of its height (in meters per second) will be related to the rate of change of its velocity (in meters per second). We can use differentiation to calculate the rate of change of the height in relation to the velocity.

If we know the height and velocity at a particular instant, we can then use calculus to find out how these quantities change over time. This information can be used to predict the behavior of the system. Related rates problems can be challenging, but they are also interesting and enjoyable to solve. With a little practice, you will be able to master this essential technique.

Suppose you're driving down a straight road at a constant speed. In this case, your speedometer is linear: it tells you exactly how fast you're going. But what if you're driving around a curve? To get an accurate reading of your actual speed, you need to linearize.

This is where differentiation comes in. Differentiation allows us to take a nonlinear function and turn it into a linear function.

In other words, it allows us to find the straight-line approximation of a curve. This is essential for many applications, such as navigation and control systems. Differentiation is also a vital tool in calculus, which is the mathematics of change. By understanding differentiation, we can begin to understand how things change over time.

This book will help you, among other things, understand how to do calculus. It will teach you how to find the rate of change of a function and how to use differentiation to solve problems. You will also learn about inverse functions and related rates.

Differentiation is one of the most fundamental concepts in calculus, and it can be challenging to wrap your head around it. However, there are a few tricks that can make differentiation a little easier to understand.

First, make sure you have a strong foundation in algebra. Differentiation involves working with equations and solving for variables, so being comfortable with algebra is essential. Next, start with the basics of differentiation and work your way up to more complex concepts. And finally, don't be afraid to use visual aids. Drawing graphs and charts can be helpful when trying to understand how differentiation works. By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming a calculus master!

When it comes to teaching calculus, there's no one ``right" way. However, there are some differentiation techniques that are more effective than others. For example, using a graphing calculator (or even python) can help students visualize complicated concepts, and working with real-world data can make abstract calculations more relatable. With a little practice, you will be able to master these essential skills.




## Derivative as a Function

## The Definition of Derivative

The first main idea of calculus is of course, the limit. A \index{limiting process} **limiting process**  can be used in the study of curves in general; but the derivative the main limiting  process that has lead to the development of calculus. 


Given a function $f$ of  a real variable $x$ and a positive change in $x$, say $\Delta  x$, the  expression 
$$
\frac{f(x+\Delta  x)-f(x)}{\Delta  x}
$$ 
is called the \index{difference quotient} **difference quotient**  and is the formula for the slope of a secant line to the graph of $f$ through the points $(x,f(x))$ and $(x+\Delta  x,f(x+\Delta  x)).$ 

The limiting process illustrated in the examples below was first developed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat. The following definition was realized by Newton and Leibniz.


::: {#def- } 
The \index{derivative of a function} **derivative of a function**  $y=f(x)$ for any $x$ is defined by
$$
f'(x)=\lim _{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$
provided this limit exists. The derivative is also denoted by $\frac{d y}{d x};$ and other common notations are $y'$, $\frac{d f}{d x}$, and
$D_x(y).$ Also the limit is sometimes denoted by
$$
\frac{d y}{d x}=\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{\Delta  y}{\Delta  x}=\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta  x)-f(x)}{\Delta  x}=f'(x).
$$
The process of finding the derivative is called \index{differentiation} **differentiation**. A function $f$ is called \index{differentiable} **differentiable** at $x$ when the defining limit exists; and we say that $f$ is \index{differentiable} on $(a,b)$ when $f$ is differentiable at every point in $(a,b).$

## Taking the Derivative Using the Definition

In the following examples we illustrate how to find the derivative function using the definition of the derivative. 


::: {#exm- } 
Find the derivative of the function using the definition of the derivative given $f(x)=x^3$ at $(1,1).$
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution]
By definition we compute the limit, as follows,
\begin{align*}
f'(x) & =  \lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta  x)-f(x)}{\Delta  x}  \\
& =  \lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{x^3+3 x^2 (\Delta  x)+3 x (\Delta  x)^2+(\Delta  x)^3-x^3}{\Delta  x} \\
& =  \lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{3 x^2 (\Delta  x)+3 x (\Delta  x)^2+(\Delta  x)^3}{\Delta  x}  \\
& =  \lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\left( 3 x^2 +3 x (\Delta  x)+(\Delta  x)^2 \right) 
=  3 x^2
\end{align*}
which is the derivative of $f$ for any $x.$ At $x=1,$ we have $f'(1)=1.$
::: 


::: {#exm- } 
Find the derivative of the function using the definition of the derivative given $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ at $(8,2).$
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution]
By the definition of the derivative,  
\begin{align*}
f'(x) & = \lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta  x)-f(x)}{\Delta  x} 
=\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{\sqrt[3]{(x+\Delta  x)}-\sqrt[3]{x}}{\Delta  x} \\
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\left(\frac{\sqrt[3]{(x+\Delta  x)}-\sqrt[3]{x}}{\Delta  x}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt[3]{(x+\Delta  x)^2}+\sqrt[3]{(x+\Delta  x)x}+\sqrt[3]{x^2}}{\sqrt[3]{(x+\Delta  x)^2}+\sqrt[3]{(x+\Delta  x)x}+\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\right) \\
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\left(\frac{x+\Delta  x-x}{\Delta  x\left(\sqrt[3]{(x+\Delta  x)^2}+\sqrt[3]{(x+\Delta  x)x}+\sqrt[3]{x^2}\right)}\right) \\
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{(x+\Delta  x)^2}+\sqrt[3]{(x+\Delta  x)x}+\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\right) 
 =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{x^2}}
\end{align*}
which is the derivative of $f$ for any $x.$ At $x=8,$ we have $f'(8)=\frac{1}{12}.$

## Finding an Equation of the Tangent Line


::: {#thm- } 
The slope of the tangent line to the function at $\left(x_0,f\left(x_0\right)\right)$ is $m=f'\left(x_0\right)$ and $y=f'\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)+f\left(x_0\right)$ is an equation of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x=x_0$.
::: 

::: {.proof }
By definition, the \index{slope of the tangent line} **slope of the tangent line**  at $x_0$ is $f'(x_0)$, therefore an equation of the tangent line that passes through $\left(x_0,f\left(x_0\right)\right)$ is $y=f'\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)+f\left(x_0\right).$
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
Differentiate the function $\displaystyle f(x)=x+\frac{9}{x}$ and find the slope of the tangent line at the point where $x=-3.$
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution]
To find the slope of the tangent line we determine the derivative of the function,
\begin{align*}
f'(x) & =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta  x)-f(x)}{\Delta  x} \\ 
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{3\sqrt{-(x+\Delta  x)}-3\sqrt{-x}}{\Delta  x} \\ 
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\left(3\frac{\sqrt{-(x+\Delta  x)}-\sqrt{-x}}{\Delta  x}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{-(x+\Delta  x)}+\sqrt{-x}}{\sqrt{-(x+\Delta  x)}+\sqrt{-x}}\right) \\ 
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\left(3\frac{-(x+\Delta  x)-(-x)}{\Delta  x\left(\sqrt{-(x+\Delta  x)}+\sqrt{-x}\right)}\right) \\ 
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\left(3\frac{-\Delta  x}{\Delta  x\left(\sqrt{-(x+\Delta  x)}+\sqrt{-x}\right)}\right) \\ 
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\left(\frac{-3}{\sqrt{-(x+\Delta  x)}+\sqrt{-x}}\right) \\ 
& =-\frac{3}{2 \sqrt{-x}}
\end{align*}
which is the derivative of the function $f$ for any $x<0.$ At $x=-2,$ we have
$$
f'(-2)=-\frac{3}{2 \sqrt{-(-2)}}=-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4}.
$$
Therefore, an equation of the tangent line at $x=-2$ is
\begin{align*}
& y=f'\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)+f\left(x_0\right) =-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4} (x+2)+3\sqrt{2}.
\end{align*}
::: 


::: {#exm- } 
Find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of 
$$
g(x)=\frac{1-x}{2+x}
$$
 at $x=-1.$
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution]
To find the slope of the tangent line we compute the derivative of the function,
\begin{align*}
g'(x) & =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta  x)-f(x)}{\Delta  x} \\ 
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{\frac{1-(x+\Delta  x)}{2+(x+\Delta  x)}-\frac{1-x}{2+x}}{\Delta  x} \\ 
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{\left(\frac{1-(x+\Delta  x)}{2+(x+\Delta  x)}\right)\left(\frac{2+x}{2+x}\right)-\left(\frac{1-x}{2+x}\right)\left(\frac{2+(x+\Delta x)}{2+(x+\Delta  x)}\right)}{\Delta  x} \\ 
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{-3\Delta  x}{\Delta  x(2+(x+\Delta  x))(2+x)} \\ 
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{-3}{(2+(x+\Delta  x))(2+x)} \\ 
& =\frac{-3}{(2+x)^2}
\end{align*}
At $x=-1,$ we have
$$
g'(-1)=\frac{-3}{(2+(-1))^2}=-3.
$$
Therefore, an equation of the tangent line at $x=-1$ is
$$
y=f'\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)+f\left(x_0\right) = -3 (x+1)+2.
$$

## Examples of Non-differentiable Functions


::: {#exm- } 
Give three examples of functions $f$ where $f$ is not differentiable at $x=c$ but $f$ is continuous at
$x=c.$
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution]
The function $f(x)=|x|$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ since
$$
\lim _{h\to 0^-}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}=\lim _{h\to 0^-}\frac{|h|}{h}=-1
$$
$$
\lim _{h\to 0^+}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}=\lim _{h\to 0^+}\frac{|h|}{h}=1
$$
which proves the two-sided limit (the derivative) 
$$
\lim _{h\to 0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}
$$
does not exist. 
This type of example where the function is not differentiable is called a \index{corner point} **corner point** . 
 
Secondly, the function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x^2}$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ since
$$
\lim _{h\to 0^-}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}=\lim _{h\to 0^-}\frac{\sqrt[3]{h^2}}{h}
=\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{h}}=-\infty
$$
$$
\lim _{h\to 0^+}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}=\lim _{h\to 0^+}\frac{\sqrt[3]{h^2}}{h}
=\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{h}}=+\infty
$$
which proves the two-sided limit (the derivative) 
$$
\lim _{h\to 0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}
$$ 
does not exist. 
This type of example where the function is not differentiable is called a \index{vertical tangent} **vertical tangent** .  
 
Thirdly, the function
$$ 
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
x-1 & \text{ if } x<0 \\   
2x & \text{ if } x\geq  0
\end{cases}
$$
is not differentiable at $x=0$ since
$$
\lim _{h\to 0^-}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}=\lim _{h\to 0^-}\frac{h}{h}=1
$$
$$
\lim _{h\to 0^+}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}=\lim _{h\to 0^+}\frac{2h}{h}=2
$$
which proves the two-sided limit (the derivative) 
$$
\lim _{h\to 0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}
$$
does not exist. 
In this third example, does $f$ have a corner point at $x=0$ or is it a vertical tangent at $x=0$?
::: 

::: {#exm- } 

Compute the difference quotient for the function defined by
$$
f(x)=\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
 \displaystyle \frac{\sin  x}{x} & \text{ if } x\neq 0 \\ 
 1 & \text{ if } x=0
\end{array}
\right .
$$
Do you think $f$ is differentiable at $x=0$? If so, what is the equation of the tangent line at $x=0$?
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution]
For $x\neq 0,$ we find,
$$
f'(x)=\lim _{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=\lim _{h\to 0 }\frac{\frac{\sin (x+h)}{x+h}-\frac{\sin  x}{x}}{h}.
$$
At $x=0$ we have,
$$
f'(0)=\lim _{h\to 0 }\frac{\frac{\sin (h)}{h}-1}{h}.
$$
Using a table of values to compute the limit we infer that $f'(0)=0$
and so the equation of the tangent line is $y=1.$
::: 

## Differentiability Implies Contunuity


::: {#thm- } 
If a function $f$ is differentiable at $x=c,$ then it is also continuous at $x=c$.
::: 

::: {.proof }
Assume that $f$ is a differentiable function, then by definition
$$
f'(c) =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f(c+\Delta  x)-f(c)}{\Delta  x}
$$
exists, and therefore we can use the product rule for limits with
\begin{align*}
& \lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}f(c+\Delta  x)-f(c) \\ 
& \qquad =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f(c+\Delta  x)-f(c)}{\Delta  x}\Delta  x \\ 
&\qquad =\left( \lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f(c+\Delta  x)-f(c)}{\Delta  x} \right)\left( \lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\Delta  x \right)\\ 
&\qquad =f'(c)(0) \\ 
& \qquad =0
\end{align*}
Whence, 
$$
\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}f(c+\Delta  x)=f(c)
$$
and so $f$ is continuous at $x=c.$

## Basic Rules of Differentiation

## Linearity

Computing the limit of the difference quotient can be tedious and require ingenuity; fortunately for a large number of common functions there is a better way to compute the derivative. In this section, we detail the \index{power rule} **power rule**, \index{product rule} **product rule** and the \index{quotient rule} **quotient rule** for differentiation. These rules greatly simplify the task of differentiation. We also give examples on how to find the tangent line give some geometric information; and to find the horizontal tangent lines to the graph of a given function.

The next theorem states the common procedural rules for taking derivatives. For example, the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of the derivative functions. The same is not true for a product of functions. To convince yourself that the derivative of the product of two functions is not the product of the derivative functions try an example, say $f(x)=x^2$ and $g(x)=x^3.$

::: {#thm- } [Differentiation Rules]
Let $f$ and $g$ be functions. 
 
- (Constant Rule) 
If $f$ is a constant function, $f(x)=c$ for some real number $c,$ then $f'(x)=0.$
- (Power Rule) 
If $f$ is a power function, $f(x)=x^n$ for some real number $n$, then $f(x)=n x^{n-1}.$
- (Sum Rule) 
If $f=g+h$ for any differentiable functions $g$ and $h,$ then $f'=g'+h'.$
- (Difference Rule) 
If $f=g-h$ for any differentiable functions $g$ and $h,$ then $f'=g'-h'.$
- (Linearity Rule) 
If $f=a g+b h$ for any differentiable functions $g$ and $h$, and any two constants $a$ and $b$, then $f'=a g'+b h'.$

## Higher Order Derivatives


If $f$ is a differentiable function, then its derivative $f'$ is also a function, so $f'$ may have a derivative of its own, denoted by $(f')'=f''.$ 
This function $f''$ is called the \index{second derivative} **second derivative**  of $f.$  
Moreover, the second derivative may be differentiable. 
Further, the \index{third derivative} **third derivative** is defined as $(f'')'$ and is denoted by $f'''$; and the \index{fourth derivative} **fourth derivative** is defined as $(f''')'$ and is denoted by $f^{(4)}$, provided these functions exist. 
In general, if $f^{(n)}$ is differentiable, then $\left(f^{(n)}\right)'=f^{(n+1)}$ is the $(n+1)^{th}$ derivative of $f.$  
In Leibniz notation the first, second, third and $n$-th derivatives are
\begin{align*}
& y'=\frac{d y}{d x} \\
& y''=\frac{d }{d x}\left(\frac{d y}{d x}\right)=\frac{d^2y}{d x^2} \\
& y'''=\frac{d}{d x}\left(\frac{d^2y}{d x^2}\right)=\frac{d^3y}{d x^3} \\
& \cdots \\
&  y^{(n)}=\frac{d^ny}{d x^n}
\end{align*}
respectively.

 =\left(2x^3+3x\right)'h(x)+g(x)\left(x^2-3\right)' \\

We use the product rule with $g(x)=\left(x^2+3x\right)(3-x)$, $h(x)=x^4+5x-2$ and $f(x)=g(x) h(x).$ We find
\begin{align*}
f'(x) & =g'(x)h(x)+g(x)h'(x) \\

\end{align*}
Since
\begin{align*}
\left[\left(x^2+3x\right)(3-x)\right]' & =\left(x^2+3x\right)'(3-x)+\left(x^2+3x\right)(3-x)' \\

$$
f'(x) =\left(9-3 x^2\right)\left(x^4+5x-2\right)+\left(x^2+3x\right)(3-x)\left(4x^3+5\right)

\end{align*}
which simplifies to
\begin{equation*}
f'(x)=\frac{9}{4 x^2}-\frac{169}{4 (x-4)^2}+4+2x=\frac{2 \left(18-9 x+12 x^2-6 x^4+x^5\right)}{(-4+x)^2 x^2}.

Using the quotient rule with $f(x)=g(x)/h(x)$, $g(x)=a x+b$, and $h(x)=c x+d$ we find

## Role of the Derivative

## Average Rate of Change


In general, suppose an object moves along a straight line according to an equation of motion $s=f(t),$ where $s$ is the \index{displacement} **displacement** (\index{directed distance} **directed distance**) of the object from the origin at time $t.$  
The function $f$ that describes the motion is called the \index{position function} **position function**  of the object. 
In the time interval from $t=a$ to $t=a+h$  the change in position is $f(a+h)-f(a)$ and the \index{average velocity} **average velocity**  over this time interval is 
$$
\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
$$ 
which is the same as the slope of the secant line through these two points.

If a billiard is dropped from a height of 500 feet, its height $s$  at time $t$  is given by the position function $s=-16t^2+500$  where $s$  is measured in feet and $t$  is measured in seconds. 
Find the average velocity over the intervals $[2,2.5]$ and $[2,2.6]$.  
::: 

::: {.solution }
For the interval $[2,2.5],$ the object falls from a height of $s(2)=-16(2)^2+500=436$  feet to a height of $s(2.5)=-16(2.5)^2+500=400.$  
The average velocity is 
$$
\frac{\Delta  s}{\Delta  t}=\frac{s(2.5)-s(2)}{2.5-2}=\frac{400-436}{2.5-2}=-72.
$$
For the interval $[2,2.6],$ the object falls from a height of $s(2)=436$  feet to a height of $s(2.6)=391.84.$  
The average velocity is 
$$
\frac{\Delta  s}{\Delta  t}=\frac{s(2.6)-s(2)}{2.6-2}=\frac{391.84-436}{2.6-2}=-73.6.
$$
Note that the average velocities are negative indicating that the object is moving downward.
::: 

## Instantaneous Rate of Change


The difference quotient 
$$
\frac{\Delta  y}{\Delta  x}=\frac{f\left(x_2\right)-f\left(x_1\right)}{x_2-x_1}
$$
is the average rate of change of $y$  with respect to $x$  over the interval $\left[x_1,x_2\right]$ and can be interpreted as the slope of the secant line.
Its limit as $\Delta x\to 0$  is the derivative at $x=x_1$ and is denoted by $f'\left(x_1\right).$  
We interpret the limit of the average rate of change as the interval becomes smaller and smaller to be the instantaneous rate of change. 
Often, different branches of science have specific interpretations of the derivative.


As $\Delta  x\to 0$  the average rate of change approaches the \index{instantaneous rate for change} **instantaneous rate for change** ; that
is, 
$$
\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0} \frac{\Delta  y}{\Delta  x} = f'(x)
$$ 
and is also known as the \index{derivative} **derivative**  of $f$  at $x.$ 


## Free-Falling Body


Basically, \index{rectilinear motion} **rectilinear motion** refers to the motion of an object that can be modeled along a straight line; and the so-called \index{falling body problems} **falling body problems**  are a special type of rectilinear motion where the motion of an object is falling (or propelled) in a vertical direction. 
Another type of rectilinear motion is the \index{free-falling body problem} **free-falling body problem**.


The position of a free-falling body (neglect air resistance) under the influence of gravity can be represented by the function  
$$
s(t)=\frac{1}{2}g t^2+v_0t+s_0
$$
where $g$  is the acceleration due to gravity (on earth $g\approx -32 \text{ft}\left/s^2\right.$) and $s_0$  and $v_0$  are the initial height and velocity of the object (when $t=0$).

A ball is thrown vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of $160 \text{ ft/s}$. 
- When will it hit the ground?
- With what velocity will the ball hit the ground?
- When will the ball reach its maximum height and what is the maximum height?
::: 

::: {.solution }

- We can determine when the ball will hit the ground by solving 
$$
s(t)=\frac{1}{2}g t^2+v_0t+s_0=0
$$ 
for $t$. 
Using $g=-32$ , $v_0=160$ , and $s_0=0$. 
We find 
$$
s(t)=-16t^2+160 t=16t (-t+10)=0
$$ 
when $t=0$  and $t=10$. 
Thus the ball will hit the ground 10 seconds after it is thrown upwards.
- The velocity of the ball at time $t$  is given by the first derivative of $s$, namely 
$$
v(t)=s'(t)=g t+v_0.
$$ 
When $t=10$ we find, $v(10)=-32 (10)+160=-160$ and so the velocity of the ball is $-160 \text{ ft}/s$ when it hits the ground.
- The ball reaches it's maximum height when the velocity is zero, thus we solve 
$$
v(t)= g t+v_0=-32 t+160=0
$$ 
yielding $t=2$. 
Its position at $t=2$ is the maximum height which is $s(2)=16(2)(-2+10)=256$. 
Therefore, 2 seconds after the ball is thrown, the ball reaches it's maximum height of 256 ft.

- What is the \index{total distance travelled} **total distance travelled**  by the particle during the first 3 seconds?
::: 

::: {.solution }
The velocity is given by  $v(t)=x'(t)=6t^2+6 t-36.$  
The acceleration is given by $a(t)=v'(t)=x''(t)=12 t+6.$  
Since $v(t)=0$  when  
$$
6t^2+6t-36=6(t-2)(t+3)=0
$$ 
so $t=2, -3$ but $-3$ is not on $[0,3]$. 
Therefore, the distance covered is
$$
|x(2)-x(0)|+|x(3)-x(2)|=|-4-40|+|13-(-4)|=61.

For the derivative of the \index{cosecant function} **cosecant function** , we use the formula 
$$
 \displaystyle \csc  x=\frac{1}{\sin  x}

## Chain Rule

## The Chain Rule and Its Proof

With a lot of work, we can sometimes find derivatives without using the chain rule either by expanding a polynomial, by using another differentiation rule, or maybe by using a trigonometric identity. The derivative would be the same in either approach; however, the chain rule allows us to find derivatives that would otherwise be very difficult to handle. This section gives plenty of examples of the use of the chain rule as well as an easily understandable proof of the chain rule.


::: {#thm- } [Chain Rule]
Suppose $f$ is a differentiable function of $u$ which is a differentiable function of $x.$ Then $f(u(x))$ is a differentiable function of $x$ and 
$$
\frac{d f}{d x}=\frac{df}{du}\frac{du}{dx}.
$$
::: 

::: {.proof }
We wish to show $\frac{d f}{d x}=\frac{df}{du}\frac{du}{dx}$ and will do so by using the definition of the derivative for the function $f$ with respect to $x,$ namely,  
$$
\frac{df}{dx}=\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f[u(x+\Delta  x)]-f[u(x)]}{\Delta  x}
$$
To better work with this limit let's define an auxiliary function:
$$
g(t)=\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
  \frac{f[u(x)+t]-f[u(x)]}{t}-\frac{df}{du} & \text{ if } t\neq 0 \\
 0 & \text{ if } t=0
\end{array}
\right.
$$
Let $\Delta  u=u(x+\Delta  x)-u(x),$ then three properties of the function $g$ are 
 
- $g(\Delta  u)=\frac{f[u(x)+\Delta  u]-f[u(x)]}{\Delta  u}-\frac{df}{du}$ provided $\Delta  u\neq 0$
- $\left[g(\Delta  u)+\frac{df}{du}\right]\Delta  u=f[u(x)+\Delta  u]-f[u(x)]$
- $g$ is continuous at $t=0$ since $\lim _{t\to 0}\left[\frac{f[u(x)+t]-f[u(x)]}{t}\right]=\frac{df}{du}$
 
Now we can rewrite $\frac{df}{dx}$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
\frac{df}{dx} & =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f[u(x+\Delta  x)]-f[u(x)]}{\Delta  x} 
 =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f[u(x)+\Delta  u]-f[u(x)]}{\Delta  x} \\
& =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{\left(g(\Delta  u)+\frac{df}{du}\right)\Delta  u}{\Delta  x}
 =\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\left(g(\Delta  u)+\frac{df}{du}\right)\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{\Delta  u}{\Delta  x} \\
& =\left[\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}g(\Delta  u)+\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{df}{du}\right]\text{   }\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{\Delta
 u}{\Delta  x} \\
& =\left[g\left( \lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\Delta  u \right)+\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{df}{du}\right]\text{   }\lim _{\Delta  x\to
0}\frac{\Delta  u}{\Delta  x} \\
& =\left[g(0)+\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{df}{du}\right]\text{   }\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{\Delta  u}{\Delta  x} 
=\left[0+\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{df}{du}\right]\text{   }\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{\Delta  u}{\Delta  x} 
 =\frac{df}{du}\frac{du}{dx}.
\end{align*}

::: 

::: {.solution }
By the chain rule  
$$
g'(x)=f'(3x-1)\frac{d}{dx}(3x-1)=3f'(3x-1)=\frac{3}{(3x-1)^2+1}.
$$ 
Also, by the chain rule  
$$
h'(x)=f'\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=-f'\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)=\frac{-1}{\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2+1}\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)=\frac{-1}{x^2+1}.

::: {#exm- }  
Let $f$ be a function for which $f(2)=-3$ and $\displaystyle f'(x)=\sqrt{x^2+5}.$ 
If $\displaystyle g(x)=x^2f\left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right),$ what is $g'(2)?$
::: 

::: {.solution }
Using the chain rule and the product rule we determine,  
$$
g'(x)=2x f\left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right)+x^2f'\left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right)\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right)
$$
$$
= 2x f\left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right)+x^2f'\left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right)\left(\frac{-1}{(x-1)^2}\right).

Therefore,  
$$
g'(2)=2(2) f\left(\frac{2}{2-1}\right)+2^2f'\left(\frac{2}{2-1}\right)\left(\frac{-1}{(2-1)^2}\right)=-24.

Show that if a particle moves along a straight line with position $s(t)$ and velocity $v(t),$ then its acceleration satisfies $a(t)=v(t)\frac{dv}{ds}.$ Use this formula to find $\frac{dv}{d s}$ in the case where $s(t)=-2t^3+4t^2+t-3.$
::: 

::: {.solution }
By the chain rule,  
$$
a(t)=\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{dv}{d s}\frac{ds}{dt}=v(t)\frac{dv}{ds}
$$ 
In the case where $s(t)=-2t^3+4t^2+t-3;$ we determine, 
$$
\frac{ds}{dt}=v(t)=-6t^2+8t+1 \qquad \text{and } \qquad a(t)=-12t+8.

$$
\frac{dv}{d s}=\frac{-12t+8}{-6t^2+8t+1}.

Find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of the function $f(x)=\left(9-x^2\right)^{2/3}$ at the point $(1,4).$

By using the chain rule we determine,  
$$
f'(x)=\frac{2}{3}\left(9-x^2\right)^{-1/3}(-2x)=\frac{-4x}{3\sqrt[3]{9-x^2}}
$$ 
and so $f'(1)=\frac{-4}{3\sqrt[3]{9-1^2}}=\frac{-2}{3}.$ Therefore, an equation of the tangent line is $y-4=\left(\frac{-2}{3}\right)(x-1)$ which simplifies to $y=\frac{-2}{3}x+\frac{14}{3}.$

$$
f'(x)=\frac{\sqrt{2x-1}(1)-x\frac{d}{dx}\left(\sqrt{2x-1}\right)}{\left(\sqrt{2x-1}\right)^2}=\frac{\sqrt{2x-1}(1)-x \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{-1+2 x}}\right)}{\left(\sqrt{2x-1}\right)^2}
$$
which simplifies to $\displaystyle f'(x)=\frac{-1+x}{(-1+2 x)^{3/2}}.$ 
Thus the only point where $f$ has a horizontal tangent line is $(1,1)$. See Figure \ref{fig:p7}.

## Implicit Differentiation



## Implicit Differentiation as a Procedure

In this section the procedure of implicit differentiation is outlined and many examples are given. Proofs of the derivative formulas for the
inverse trigonometric functions are provided and several examples of using them are given. Also detailed is the logarithmic differentiation procedure which can simplify the process of taking derivatives of equations involving products and quotients. Finding the slope of a tangent line is a local process; for example, a circle locally around a point, can have a tangent line even though it is not a function. In fact, every circle has a tangent line at every point. 

The following process allows us to find derivatives of more general curves
(not just functions); and in particular for an implicitly defined function. Notice that the process relies heavily on the chain rule.


::: {#thm- }  [Implicit Differentiation]\index{implicit differentiation} **implicit differentiation** 
Suppose that $f(x,y)=0$ is a given equation involving both $x$ and $y$; and that $\frac{dy}{d x}$
exists at $\left(x_0,y_0\right).$ Then $\frac{dy}{d x}|_{\left(x_0,y_0\right)}$ can be found using the following procedure:
 
-   Using the chain rule where appropriate, differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x.$ 
-   If possible, solve the differentiated equation algebraically for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and evaluate at $\left(x_0,y_0\right).$

::: 

::: {.solution }
Using implicit differentiation we have,  
$$
3x^2+3y^2\frac{dy}{dx}=6y+6x\frac{dy}{dx}
$$
$$
 \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{6y-3x^2}{3y^2-6x}=\frac{x^2-2 y}{2 x-y^2}
$$ 
So an equation of the tangent line at $(3,3)$ is $\displaystyle y-3=\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{(3,3)}(x-3)$ which simplifies to $y=-x+6.$

Using implicit differentiation we have,  
$$
4\left(x^2+y^2\right)\left(2x+2y\frac{dy}{dx}\right)=50x-50y\frac{dy}{dx}$$
and so 
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{25 x-4 x \left(x^2+y^2\right)}{25 y+4 y \left(x^2+y^2\right)}
$$ 
So an equation of the tangent line at $(3,1)$ is  $y-1=\frac{dy}{dx}|_{(3,1)}(x-3)$ which simplifies to $y=\frac{-9}{13}x+\frac{40}{13}.$

Using implicit differentiation we have,  
$$
2\left(x^2+y^2\right)\left(2x+2y\frac{dy}{dx}\right)=8x-8y\frac{dy}{dx}$$
and so
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{x \left(-2+x^2+y^2\right)}{y \left(2+x^2+y^2\right)}\
$$
we need to find all $(x,y)$ where $\frac{dy}{dx}=0.$ Clearly, the point $(0,0)$ is ruled out and so $-2+x^2+y^2=0$; that is $x^2+y^2=2.$ Using $x^2+y^2=2$ with the original we see $x^2-y^2=1$ also. Therefore, $2x^2=3$ and so $x=\pm \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$ and $y=\pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}.$

Use implicit differentiation to find two points on the curve whose equation is $x^2-3x y+2y^2=-2,$ where the tangent line is vertical.
::: 

::: {.solution }
Using implicit differentiation we determine,  
$$
2x-3y-3x\frac{dy}{dx}+4y\frac{dy}{dx}=0
$$
and so,  $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{3y-2x}{4y-3x}$. Since we want vertical tangent lines we need $4y-3x=0;$ that is, $y=\frac{3}{4}x$ and with the original equation this means;  $x^2-3x \left(\frac{3}{4}x\right)+2\left(\frac{3}{4}x\right)^2=-2$ which is solved as $x=\pm 4.$ So the points where the tangent line is vertical are $(-4,-3)$ and $(4,3).$

## Logarithmic Differentiation

Logarithmic differentiation is a procedure that uses the chain rule and implicit differentiation. Basically the idea is to apply an appropriate logarithmic function to both sides of the given equation and then use some properties of logarithms to simplify before using implicit differentiation. 


::: {#thm- } [Logarithmic Differentiation]\index{logarithmic differentiation} **logarithmic differentiation** 
Suppose that $f(x,y)=0$ is a given equation involving both $x$ and $y$; and that $\frac{dy}{d x}$ exists at $\left(x_0,y_0\right).$ Then $\frac{dy}{d x}|_{\left(x_0,y_0\right)}$ can be found using the following procedure:  
 
-   Apply a logarithmic function with the appropriate base to both sides. 
-   Use properties of logarithms to simplify.  
-   Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x.$ 
-   If possible, solve the differentiated equation algebraically for $\frac{dy}{dx}.$

## Derivatives of Inverse Functions

## Inverse Functions

In this section we state the derivative rules for the natural exponential function and the general exponential function. 
We also go over several examples of the chain rule and the exponential derivative rules.


::: {#thm- } 
\index{derivative of inverse} **derivative of inverse** 
If $f$ has an interval $I$ as domain and $f'(x)$ exists and is never zero on $I,$ then $f^{-1}$ is differentiable at every point in its domain. 
The value of $\left(f^{-1}\right)'$ at a point $b$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$ is the reciprocal of the value of $f'$ at $a=f^{-1}(b)$ given by  
$$
\left(f^{-1}\right)'(b)=\frac{1}{f '\left(f^{-1}(b)\right)}.
$$
::: 


::: {#exm- } 
Let $\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{2x-3}{7-5x}.$ 
Sketch the graph of $f$ and state whether or not the graph of $f$ passes the horizontal line test. 
If so, find a rule for $f^{-1}$ and then use it to find $\left(f^{-1}\right) '(0)$. 
Verify the formula
$$
 \displaystyle \left(f^{-1}\right)'(0)=\frac{1}{f'\left(f^{-1}(0)\right)}.
$$
::: 


::: {.solution }
Notice that the graph of $f$ passes the horizontal line test, which implies that $f$ is a one-to-one function and thus must have an inverse function. 
To find the inverse function of $f$, set $y=f(x)$. 
Then simply switch the variables $x$ and $y$ and solve for $y$. 
The resulting equation will be a rule for the function $f^{-1}$. 
To see this, let $y=\frac{2x-3}{7-5x}$ and then switching the variables $x$ and $y$: $x=\frac{2y-3}{7-5y}$. 
Solving for $y$ yields: $y=\frac{3+7x}{2+5x}$. 
Thus, $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{3+7x}{2+5x}$. 
Of course since $f$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ are inverse function it must happen that $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$ and  $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for each $x$ in the domains. 
Notice that 
$$
f'(x)=-\frac{1}{(7-5 x)^2}  \qquad \text{and} \qquad (f^{-1})'(x)=-\frac{1}{(2+5 x)^2}.
$$
Also notice that 
$$
(f^{-1})'(0)=-\frac{1}{(2+5 (0))^2}=-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{f'\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}=\frac{1}{f'\left(f^{-1}(0)\right)}.
$$
::: 


::: {#exm- } 
Let $\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{5 x}{1-2x}.$ 
Without finding a rule for $f^{-1}(x)$ determine $\left(f^{-1}\right) '(1).$
::: 

::: {.solution }
Since $\displaystyle f'(x)=\frac{5}{(1-2 x)^2}$ and $\displaystyle 1=\frac{5 x}{1-2x}$ when $x=\frac{1}{7}$
$$
\left(f^{-1}\right)'(1)=\frac{1}{f '\left(f^{-1}(1)\right)}=\frac{1}{f '(1/7)}=\frac{1}{\frac{49}{5}}=\frac{5}{49}.
$$
::: 






## Derivatives of Exponential Functions


::: {#thm- } 
The derivative of the \index{exponential function} **exponential function**  $f(x)=b^x$ is $f'(x)=(\ln  b) b^x.$ 
In the special case when $b=e$ we have $f(x)=e^x$ and $f'(x)=e^x.$ 
Therefore, 
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left(b^x\right)=(\ln  b)b^x \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{d}{dx}\left(e^x\right)=e^x.
$$

Find the derivative of the function given $y(x)=1-2e^{-x^2}.$
::: 

::: {.solution }
Using the chain rule the derivative is,  
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=-2e^{-x^2}\frac{d}{dx}\left(-x^2\right)=-2e^{-x^2}(-2x)=4x e^{-x^2}.
$$
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
What is the slope of the tangent line to $\displaystyle y=\frac{e^{-x}}{1+e^{-x}}$ at $x=0?$
::: 

::: {.solution }
Using the quotient rule,
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx}& =\frac{\left(1+e^{-x}\right)\left(-e^{-x}\right)-e^{-x}\left(-e^{-x}\right)}{\left(1+e^{-x}\right)^2} \\
& =\frac{-e^{-x}\left(1+e^{-x}-e^{-x}\right)}{\left(1+e^{-x}\right)^2} 
 =\frac{-e^{-x}}{\left(1+e^{-x}\right)^2}=-\frac{e^x}{\left(1+e^x\right)^2}
\end{align*}
Therefore, the slope of the tangent line to $y$ at $x=0$ is $\frac{-e^{-(0)}}{\left(1+e^{-(0)}\right)^2}=-\frac{1}{4}.$
::: 




## Derivatives of Logarithmic Functions

::: {#thm- } 
The derivative of the \index{logarithmic function} **logarithmic function**  $f(x)=\log _bx$ is $f'(x)=1/(\ln  b) x.$ 
In the special case when $b=e$ we have $f(x)=\ln  x$ and $f'(x)=1/x.$ 
Therefore, 
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\log _bx\right)=\frac{1}{(\ln  b)x} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{d}{dx}(\ln  x)=\frac{1}{x}.
$$
::: 


::: {#exm- } 
Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve $y=x^{2 }\ln  x$ at $x=e^2.$
::: 

::: {.solution }
The derivative of $y$ is $y'=2x \ln  x+x$ and at $\left(e^2,2 e^4\right)$ we have the slope of the tangent line as $y'\left(e^2\right)=2\left(e^2\right) \ln  \left(e^2\right)+\left(e^2\right)=5 e^2.$ 
Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is $y-2e^4=5e^2\left(x-e^2\right)$ which simplifies to $y=5 e^2 x-3 e^4.$
::: 


::: {#exm- } 
For what values of $A$ and $B$ does $y=A x \ln  x+B e^x$ satisfy $y''-y=0?$
::: 

::: {.solution }
We determine, $y'=A \ln  x+A+B e^x$ $y\text{''}=\frac{A}{x}+B e^x$. 
Since $y''-y=\frac{A}{x}-A x \ln  x=0$ we find that $A=0$ and that $B$ can be any real number.

## Related Rates

In this topic we show how implicit differentiation and the chain rule can be used to calculate the rate of change of one variable in terms of the rate of change of another variable (which may be more easily measured). 


The procedure of solving a \index{related rates} **related rates**  problem is to find an equation that relates two quantities and then use the chain rule to differentiate both sides with respect to time. 
Then, from knowing the rate of change of one value at a point in time, we can calculate the rate of change of another quantity at that moment in time. 

The equation which describes the application is often derived from a verbal description and is called a \index{mathematical model} **mathematical model**  of the problem. 
For these equations we can relate different rates of change by using the chain rule and implicit differentiation.

More precisely, given a function $y=f(x)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are functions of time $t,$ we have $x=x(t)$ and $y=y(t)$; and so we can use the chain rule and implicit differentiation to determine $\frac{d y}{d t}$ and $\frac{d x}{d t}.$ 
Knowing one of these values we can calculate the other as demonstrated in the following examples.

## General vs Specific Situation


Every \index{related rates} **related rates**  problem has a general situation (properties that hold true at every instant in time) and a specific situation (properties that hold true at a particular instant in time). 
Distinguishing between these two situations is often the key to successfully solving a related-rates problem. 
Here are a few guidelines for solving related rate problems: 
 
- Read the problem carefully and identify all given quantities and unknown quantities to be determined. 
- Introduce notation, make a sketch, and label the quantities.  
- Write equations involving the variables whose rates of change either are given or are to be determined.  
- Use implicit differentiation, by differentiating both sides with respect to he appropriate variable.  
- Substitute known variables and known rates of change into the resulting equation to determine the missing rate of change.

Model a water tank by a cone 40 ft high with a circular base of radius 20 ft at the top. 
Water is flowing into the tank at a constant rate of $80 \left.\text{ft}^3\right/\min .$ 
How fast is the water level rising when the water is 12 feet deep?
::: 

::: {.solution }
Let $x$ be the radius of the top circle of the body of water and $y$ its height. 
The radius of the top circle is 20, the height of the cone is 40 ft. 
By similar triangles, $20/40=x/y$ and so $x=\frac{1}{2}y.$ 
The volume of the body of water is 
$$
V=\frac{1}{3}\pi  x^2y =\frac{1}{12}\pi  y^3.
$$ 
Then 
$$
\frac{d V}{d t}=\frac{1}{4}\pi  y^2 \frac{d y}{d t}.
$$ 
When $y=12,$ $x=6,$ and $\frac{d V}{d t}=80,$ we have $$80=\frac{1}{4}\pi (12)^2 \frac{d y}{d t}$$ and thus 
$$
\frac{d y}{d t}=\frac{80(4)}{\pi (144)} \text{ft.}/\min = \frac{20}{9 \pi } \text{ft.}/\min  \approx 0.71 \text{ft.}/\min .

Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon at a rate of 4.5 cubic feet per minute. 
Find the rate of change of the radius when the radius is 2 feet.
::: 

::: {.solution }
Let $V$ be the volume of the balloon and let $r$ be the radius. 
Because the volume is increasing at a rate of 4.5 cubic feet per minute, we know that at time $t$ the rate of change of the volume is $\frac{d V}{d t}=\frac{9}{2}.$ 
The equation that relates the radius $r$ to the volume $V$ is $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi  r^3.$ 
So we have 
$$
\frac{d V}{d t}=4\pi  r^2\frac{d r}{d t}
$$ 
and by solving for $\frac{d r}{dt}$ we have 
$$
\frac{d r}{d t}=\frac{1}{4\pi  r^2}\left(\frac{d V}{d t}\right).
$$ 
Finally, when $r=2,$ the rate of change of the radius is 
$$
\frac{d r}{d t}=\frac{1}{16 \pi }\left(\frac{9}{2}\right) \approx 0.09
$$

::: 

::: {.solution }
For the area of a circle we use $A=\pi  r^2$ and we differentiate implicitly with respect to time $t$ leading to 
$$
\frac{d A}{d t}=2\pi  r \frac{d r}{d t}
$$ 
by using the chain rule. 
Since $\frac{d r}{d t}=1$ and when $r=4$ we have

A ladder 10 ft long rests against a vertical wall. 
If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 1 ft/s, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 ft from the wall?
::: 

::: {.solution }
Let $x$ meters be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall and $y$ meters the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. 
Since $x$ and $y$ are functions of time and $\frac{d x}{d t}$= 1 ft/s we are asked to find $\frac{d y}{d t}$ when $x=6$ ft. 
The relationship between $x$ and $y$ is the Pythagorean Theorem, namely $x^2+y^2=100.$ 
Using implicit differentiation and the chain rule we have 
$$
2 x \frac{d x}{d t}+2 y \frac{d y}{d t}=0.
$$ 
By solving for $\frac{d y}{d t}$ we have 
$$
\frac{d y}{d t}=-\frac{x}{y}\frac{d x}{d t}.
$$ 
When $x=6$ then $y=8 $,
$$
\frac{d y}{ d t}=\frac{-6}{8}(1) =\frac{-3}{4} \text{ ft/s.}

Car A is going west at 50 mi/h and car B is going north at 60 mi/h. 
Both are headed for the intersection of the two roads. 
At what rate are the cars approaching each other when car A is $0.3$ mi and car B is $0.4$ mi from the intersection?
::: 

::: {.solution }
At a given time $t,$ let $x$ be the distance from car $A$ to the point of intersection $P$ and let $y$ be the distance from car B to $P$ and let $z$ be the distance between the cars, where $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are measured in miles. Since $x$ and $y$ are decreasing we take the derivatives to be negative and so we are given 
$$
\frac{d x}{d t}=-50 \text{ mi/h} 
\qquad \text{and} \qquad 
\frac{d y}{d t}=-60 \text{ mi/h}.
$$ 
To find $\frac{d z}{d t}$ we use the Pythagorean Theorem, namely $x^2+y^2=z^2$ and differentiate with respect to time $t$. 
We have 
$$
2 z \frac{d z}{d t}=2 x\frac{d x}{d t}+2 y\frac{d y}{d t}
$$
and by solving for $\frac{d z}{d t}$ we have 
$$
\frac{d z}{d t}=\frac{1}{z}\left(x\frac{d x}{d t}+ y\frac{d y}{d t}\right).
$$ 
Now when $x=0.3$ mi and $y=0.4$ mi we have $z=0.5$ mi and so  
$$
\frac{d z}{d t}=\frac{1}{0.5}[0.3(-50)+0.4(-60)]=-78 \text{ mi/h}.
$$ 
Therefore, the cars are approaching each other at a rate of 78 mi/h.

Let $x$ be the length of the shadow and $y$ be the distance of the person from the street light. 
Using similar triangles,  $x/6=(x+y)/18$ and by solving for $y$ we have $y=2x.$ 
Thus, $d y/d t=2 (d x/ d t)$ and given that $d y/ d t=5 \text{ft}/s$ we find that $d x/ d t=2.5 \text{ft}/s$ is the rate the shadow is lengthening.

At noon, a ship sails due north from a point $P$ at 8 knots. 
Another ship, sailing at 12 knots, leaves the same point 1 h later on a course $60{}^{\circ}$ east of north. 
How fast is the distance between the ships increasing at 5 P.M.?
::: 

::: {.solution }
Let $A$ be the distance travelled by the first ship, and $B$ for the distance travelled by the second ship, $D$ for the distance between them, and $\theta$ the constant angle of $60{}^{\circ}.$ 
We need to find $\frac{d D}{d t}$ at $t=5.$ 
The equation that relates all the variables is the law of cosines and is  $D^2=A^2+B^2-2 A B \cos \text{  }60{}^{\circ}.$  
Using the chain rule and implicit differentiation we have  
$$
2 D \frac{d D}{d t}=2 A \frac{d A}{d t}+ 2B \frac{d B}{d t}-2\left(A \frac{d B}{d t}+B \frac{d A}{d t}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
$$ 
since $\cos  60{}^{\circ}=\frac{1}{2}$.
Then at $t=5,$ $A=5(8)$ $=\text{40,}$ $B=12(4)$ $=\text{48,}$ $\frac{d A}{d t}=8,$ $\frac{d B}{ d t}=12,$ and 
$$
D=\sqrt{40^2+48^2-2(40)(48)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}=\sqrt{1984}.
$$
So we have,  
\begin{align*}
\frac{d D}{d t}
& =\frac{2 (40) (8)+ 2(48) (12)-(40) (12)-(48)(8)}{2 \sqrt{1984}} \\ 
& =\frac{58}{\sqrt{31}}  \text{ knots} \approx 10.4171 \text{ knots}.

## Linearization and Differentials


## Differentials

In this section differentials are motivated, defined, and then used to approximate real numbers. 
The linearization of a function around a point (via the
tangent line) is illustrated.  


Let $y=f(x)$ where $f$ is a differentiable function. 
The \index{differential} **differential**  $d y$ represents the amount that the tangent line rises or falls, whereas $\Delta  y$ represents the amount that the curve $y=f(x)$ rises or falls when $x$ changes by an amount $d x.$ 
Since 
$$
\frac{d y}{d x}=\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{\Delta  y}{\Delta  x}
$$ 
we have 
$$
\frac{\Delta  y}{\Delta  x}\approx \frac{d y}{d x} \qquad \text{whenever} \qquad  
\Delta  x \approx 0
$$
If we take $d x=\Delta  x,$ then we have $\Delta  y\approx d y$ which says that the actual change in $y$ is approximately equal to the differential $d y.$ 

If $f\left(x_1\right)$ is a known number and it is desired to calculate an approximate value for $f\left(x_1+\Delta  x\right)$ where $\Delta  x$ is small, then 
$$
f\left(x_1+\Delta  x\right)\approx f\left(x_1\right)+d y.
$$


::: {#def- }

$$
and so the differential of $y$ is  
$$
d y=\left(10 (-2+2 x) \left(-3-2 x+x^2\right)^9\right)d x.
$$

$$
and so the differential of $y$ is  
$$
d y=\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{-1+2 x}}{2 \sqrt{-1+2 x} \sqrt{x+\sqrt{-1+2 x}}}\right)d x.

$$
\sqrt[3]{218}=f(216+2)\approx f(216)+d y=6+\left(\frac{1}{3 (216)^{2/3}}\right)(2)=\frac{325}{54}=6.01852.

$$
\sqrt[3]{1.02}+\sqrt[4]{1.02}=f(1+0.02)\approx f(1)+d y =2+\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{3}\right)(0.02)=\frac{1207}{600}=2.011\overline{6}

## Linearization


::: {#def- } 
The approximation  
$$
f(x)\approx f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)
$$ 
is called the \index{linear approximation} **linear approximation** (or sometimes the \index{tangent line approximation} **tangent line approximation**) of $f$ at $a$ and the function  
$$
L(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)
$$ 
is called the \index{linearization} **linearization**  of $f$ at $a.$ 
::: 

The equation of the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at $(a, f(a))$ is  $y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$  which is $y=f(a)+f'(a)d x$ so that in fact we have $y=f(a)+d y.$ 
Thus when using differentials to approximate, that is, when using $f(x+\Delta  x)\approx f(x)+d y$ to approximate we are using the tangent line at $(a, f(a))$ as an approximation to the curve $y=f(x)$ when $a$ is near $x.$

Next we find the linearization for a given function at a given value.

L(x) & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\left(-\frac{1}{4 \sqrt{2}}\right)x 
\end{align*}
Therefore, we have the linear approximation 
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2+x}}\approx \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}+\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{8}\right)x
$$
for when $x$ is near 0.

=f(0)+\left[-\frac{8}{(1+2 (0))^5}\right](x-0) =1-8x. 
\end{align*} 
Therefore, we have the linear approximation 
$$
\frac{1}{(1+2x)^4}\approx 1-8x

for when $x$ is near 0.
