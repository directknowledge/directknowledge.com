# Applications of Integrals

Integration is a mathematical process that allows us to find the area under a curve, or to solve other problems involving functions. In this book, we will explore the applications of integration in detail, and learn how to apply it in various situations. 

We will start with the basics of finding volumes, including the washer method and the shell method. From there, we will move on to more advanced applications. With practice, you will be able to apply these ideas and use integration to solve problems yet to be discovered.

Integrals are one of the most important concepts in mathematics, with applications in calculus, physics, engineering, and more. Simply put, an integral is a way to calculate the area under a curve. This can be used to determine the velocity of an object, the volume of a three-dimensional object, or even the length of a curve. In essence, integrals allow us to determine things that would otherwise be impossible to calculate. 

Of course, integrals are just one part of calculus; there are also derivatives, limits, and so on. But without integrals, many of the things we take for granted would be impossible. So next time you see a complicated equation involving an integral, remember that it just represents someone's attempt to calculate something important.

The applications of integration are vast and include finding the volume or mass of an object, calculating work done or energy transferred, and solving many types of differential equations. 

In this book, we will explore the applications of integration and how to apply it in various situations. So if you're ready to learn about the applications of integration, let's get started!

Calculus is all about finding the area between curves. And while that may sound like a rather esoteric focus, the applications of integration are actually quite practical. 

For example, consider a firm that wants to determine how much material to order for manufacturing a product. The company knows the length of the product and the amount of material required per unit length. To find out how much material to order, they need to integrate the function that represents the amount of material required over the length of the product. 

In other words, they need to find the area between the curve representing the amount of material required and an axis. Similarly, if a company wants to calculate how much money it will save by reducing its energy consumption, it needs to find the area between the two functions representing its current and proposed energy consumption rates. 

As these examples illustrate, integration is a powerful tool with numerous applications in the business world. So next time you see a calculus problem involving the area between curves, don't be discouraged - remember that there's a practical application for all that math!

Have you ever wondered how engineers calculate the volume of irregularly shaped objects? The answer lies in a branch of mathematics called integral calculus. One of the applications of integration is calculating the volume of a solid object by revolving a two-dimensional shape around an axis. This technique is known as the method of volumes of solids of revolution. To use this method, you first need to identify a suitable axis of revolution. This is typically a line that passes through the center of the object. 

Once you have chosen an axis, you need to determine the equation that describes the shape. For example, if you were calculating the volume of a cylindrical container, you would use the equation for a circle. You then need to integrate this equation to find the area enclosed by the shape. Finally, you need to multiply this area by the length of the axis of revolution to find the volume. Although it may seem like a lot of work, the method of volumes of solids of revolution can be used to calculate the volumes of all sorts of objects, from coffee cups to oil tanks.

The Disk Method is a simple way to find volumes, but it has its limitations. First, it only works for solids that are rotationally symmetric about one axis. Second, it only works for solids with flat or circular bases. However, despite these limitations, the disk method is still a useful tool for finding volumes and has applications in many different fields.

The Washer Method is a volume of solids of revolution technique that can be applied to a wide variety of applications of integration. In essence, the washer method calculates the volume of an object that has been revolved around an axis by cleverly dividing the object into infinitely thin slices, and then calculating the volume of each slice. 

The key to understanding the washer method is to remember that each slice must have a constant cross-sectional area; otherwise, the volume calculation will be inaccurate. Once this concept is understood, the applications of the washer method are nearly endless. From calculating the volumes of simple objects like cylinders and spheres to more complex objects like cones and toruses, the Washer Method is a powerful tool.

The Shell Method is also one of the applications of integration that can be used to calculate the volumes of certain solids. This method is most often used when calculating the volumes of solids of revolution, which are created when a curve is rotated about an axis. The shell method involves slicing the solid into thin shells and then calculating the volume of each individual shell. This method can be used to calculate the volumes of solids with a variety of shapes, including cylinders, spheres, and cones. While the shell method can be somewhat tricky to master, it is a powerful tool for calculating the volumes of solids of revolution.

As every math student knows, integration is a powerful tool with a wide range of applications. One of the most common applications of integration is finding the arc length of a curve. By using a small angle approximation, you can break up the arc into a series of straight line segments. To do this, you need to first break up the arc into small segments. Then, you take the length of each segment and multiply it by the corresponding width. Finally, you add up all of the lengths to get the total length of the arc.

It might sound complicated, but it's actually quite simple. And once you know how to do it, you can apply this technique to all sorts of applications. So why not give it a try? Who knows, you might just find yourself getting addicted to integration!

One of the most practical applications is in the calculation of surface area. When an object is rotated about an axis, the resulting shape is known as a surface of revolution. By using integration, it's possible to calculate the surface area of this type of object without having to take measurements of the individual components. This can be a particularly useful tool in engineering applications, where accurate measurements are crucial.

When calculating the surface area of an object, we are essentially finding the amount of material required to cover the object. This process can be applied to both regular and irregular objects. For example, when we calculate the surface area of a cylinder, we are finding the amount of material needed to cover the curved sides. In general, however, calculating the surface area of an arbitrary object can be a very difficult task. 

However, by breaking the object down into smaller pieces, we can use integration to more easily calculate its surface area. This technique is particularly helpful for surfaces of revolution, which can be difficult to visualize. By using integration, we can more easily calculate the amount of material needed to cover these complex shapes.

These are just a few of the applications of integration. As you can see, this powerful tool can be used in a wide variety of situations. Whether you're calculating the volume of an object or finding the arc length of a curve, integration is a powerful tool that every math student should master. So why not give it a try? You might just be surprised at how useful it can be!

In this book, I will take the applications of integration one by one, explaining in detail how to use them with the help of examples. I will also provide tips on when and how to use each application. By the end of this book, you will have a solid understanding of the applications of integration and how to apply it in various situations. So let's get started!




## Area Between Curves

We explain, through several examples, how to find the area between curves (as a bounded region) using integration. We demonstrate both vertical and horizontal strips and provide several exercises.

When applying the definition for \index{the area between curves} **the area between curves** , finding the intersection points of the curves and sketching their graphs is crucial. 
These graphs often reveal whether we should use vertical or horizontal strips by determining which curve is the upper curve and which is the lower. 


## Area Between Curves Using Vertical Strips

::: {#def- } 
Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous functions on $[a,b],$ and suppose that ${f(x)\geq g(x)}$ for all $x$ in $[a,b].$
Then the area of the region between the graphs of $f$ and $g$ and the vertical lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ is 
\begin{equation}
\label{vs}
A=\int_a^b [f(x)-g(x)] \, dx.
\end{equation}
::: 

In particular, if $f(x)\geq g(x)=0,$ then \eqref{vs} yields 
the area of the region bounded by: the graph of $f,$ above the $x$-axis, and between the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ as 
\begin{equation}
\label{funda}
A=\int_a^b f(x)\, dx.
\end{equation}
The reader is expected to be familiar with \eqref{funda} and also with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Then we see that we have $f(x)=2-x^2 \geq g(x)=-x$ for all $x\in [-1,2]$ as required. 

Therefore the area between the curves is 
\begin{align*}
\int_a^b [f(x)-g(x)] \, dx
& =\int_{-1}^2[(2-x^2)-(-x)]\, dx \\
& = \int_{-1}^2 (2+x-x^2)\, dx
= \left[2x+\frac{x^2}{x}-\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_{-1}^2 \\

=\frac{9}{2}
\end{align*}
as desired.

From a sketch of the graphs we see that we should consider the bounded region as two separate regions. 

We have $f(x)=\sqrt{x}\geq g(x)=0$ for all $x$ in $[0,2]$ and in the other region we have $f(x)=\sqrt{x}\geq g(x)=x-2$ for all $x$ in $[2,4].$ 
The total area is
\begin{align*}
& \int_0^2 \sqrt{x} \, dx +\int_2^4 (\sqrt{x}-x+2) \, dx \\
& \qquad =\left[\frac{2}{3}x^{2/3}\right]_0^2+\left[\frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}-\frac{x^2}{2}+2x\right]_2^4 \\ 
& \qquad =\left[\frac{2}{3}2^{2/3}\right]+\left[\frac{2}{3}4^{3/2}-\frac{4^2}{2}+2(4)\right] -\left[\frac{2}{3}2^{3/2}-\frac{2^2}{2}+2(2)\right]\\ 
& \qquad =\frac{10}{3}

From a sketch of the graph we see that we can use symmetry about the $y$-axis.
We have 
$$
{f(x)=2x^2\geq g(x)=x^4-2x^2}
$$ 
for all $x$ in $[0,2].$

The total area is
\begin{align*}
& 2 \int_{0}^2 [2x^2-(x^4-2x^2)]\, dx 
= 2 \int_{0}^2 (4 x^2 - x^4)\, dx \\
& \qquad = 2 \left(\left.\frac{4x^3}{3}-\frac{x^5}{5}\right|_0^2 \right)
= 2 \left(\frac{4(2)^3}{3}-\frac{(2)^5}{5} \right) 
= \frac{96}{5}
\end{align*}
as desired.

::: 

::: {.solution }
First we find the intersection points $(-2,-10),$ $(0,0),$ and $(2,2).$
From a sketch of the graphs wee see that we should break the bounded region into two regions. 

Notice that for all $x$ in $[-2,0]$ we have 
$$
f(x)= 2x^3-x^2-5x\geq g(x) = -x^2+3x
$$ 
and that for all $x$ in $[0,2]$ we have $f(x)= -x^2+3x\geq g(x) = 2x^3-x^2-5x.$
The total area is $16$ given by 
\begin{align*}
& \int_{-2}^0 [(2x^3-x^2-5x)-(-x^2+3x)] \, dx \\
& \qquad +
\int_0^2 [(-x^2+3x)-(2x^3-x^2-5x)]\, dx \\
& \qquad = 8+8 =16
\end{align*}
as desired.

## Area Between Curves Using Horizontal Strips

If a region's bounding curves are described by functions of $y,$ the approximating rectangles are horizontal instead of vertical and the basis formula has $y$ instead of $x.$ 

::: {#def- } 

Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous functions on $[c,d],$ and suppose that ${f(y)\geq g(y)}$ for all $y$ in $[c,d].$
Then the area of the region between the graphs of $f$ and $g$ and the horizontal lines $y=c$ and $y=d$ is 
\begin{equation}
A=\int_c^d [f(y)-g(y)] \, dy.
\end{equation}
::: 

In this equation $f$ always denotes the right-hand curve and $g$ the left-hand curve, so that $f(y)-g(y)$ is nonnegative. 

::: {#exm- } 
Find the area of the region in the first quadrant that is bounded above by $y=\sqrt{x}$ and below by the $x$-axis and the line $y=x-2.$

Here we have 
$$
f(y)=y+2\geq g(y)=y^2
$$ 
for all $y$ in $[0,2]$ as is seen in the sketch of the region. 

The total area is
\begin{align*}
& \int_0^2 [y+2-y^2] \, dy 
= \left[2y+\frac{y^2}{2}-\frac{y^3}{3}\right]_0^2 
= 4+\frac{4}{2}-\frac{8}{3} 
= \frac{10}{3}
\end{align*}
as desired.

## Volumes of Solids of Revolution

 
Finding the volume of the solid generated by rotating a bounded planar region about an axis of rotation is discussed. We cover the disk method, the washer method, and method of cylindrical shells. We provide several examples of solids generated by revolving around both vertical and horizontal lines.

The solid generated by rotating a plane region about an axis in its plane is called a \index{solid of revolution} **solid of revolution** .

## Arc Length and Surfaces of Revolution

We motivate an integration formula for finding the arc length of a smooth curve in a plane. Similarly, we use a formula for finding the surface area of the solid obtained by revolving a curve about an axis. These formulas are demonstrated with several examples and exercises are provided at the end to develop integration skills.

## Arc Length

To find a nice usable formula for finding the \emph{arc length of a curve} we will work with \emph{smooth curves}. 

::: {#def- } 
Let $y=f(x)$ be a plane curve over an interval $[a,b]$.
We say that $f$ is \index{smooth} **smooth**  whenever $f'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. 
::: 

To  find the arc length of a smooth curve we begin by dividing the curve into small segments, or \index{subcurves} **subcurves** .  
Then we approximate the curve segments by line segments and sum the lengths of the line segments to form a Riemann sum. 
We then let the number of segments increase, the corresponding Riemann sums approach a definite integral (under our assumption of smooth curve) whose value we will take to be the \index{arc length} **arc length**  $L$ of the curve.
Let's see this in more detail. 

Consider the $k$-th subinterval $[x_{k-1}, x_k]$ and the line segment between the points
\begin{equation}
(x_{k-1}, f(x_{k-1}))
\qquad \text{and} \qquad 
(x_k, f(x_k)).
\end{equation}
The change in the $y$-coordinate is denoted by 
$$
\Delta y_k = f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1}).
$$
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of each line segment is then 
\begin{equation}
\label{pthm}
\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y_k)^2} 
\qquad \text{ for $k=1,2, \ldots ,n$.}
\end{equation}
Summing these lengths we obtain an approximation for the arc length $L$ as 
\begin{equation}
\label{approx}
L\approx \sum_{k=1}^n \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y_k)^2}. 
\end{equation}


Manipulating the inside expression we obtain
\begin{equation}
L \approx \sum_{k=1}^n \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2\left(1+\left(\frac{\Delta y_k}{\Delta x}\right)^2\right)} 
= \sum_{k=1}^n \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\Delta y_k}{\Delta x}\right)^2} \Delta x.
\end{equation}
Using the Mean Value Theorem we obtain
\begin{equation}
L \approx \sum_{k=1}^n \sqrt{1+ [f'(x_k^*)]^2} \Delta x
\end{equation}
where $x_k^*$ is in the $k$-th subinterval $[x_{k-1}, x_k]$.

::: {#thm- } \label{Arc Length}
If $y=f(x)$ is a smooth curve on the interval $[a,b]$, then the arc length $L$ of this curve over $[a,b]$ is given as 
\begin{equation}
\label{arclength}
L=\int_a^b \sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}\, dx.
\end{equation}
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
Find the exact arc length of the curve $y=\frac{x^6+8}{16x^2}$ over the interval $x=2$ to $x=3$.
::: 

::: {.solution }
Notice that $f'(x)= \frac{1}{4} x^3-x^{-3}$ and so 
\begin{align*}
L & = \int_2^3 \sqrt{1+ \left(\frac{1}{16} x^6-\frac{1}{2}+x^{-6}\right)} \, dx \\
& = \int_2^3 \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}x^3+x^{-3}\right)^2} \, dx 
 = \int_2^3 \left(\frac{1}{4}x^3 + x^{-3}\right) \, dx = \frac{595}{144}.
\end{align*}
as desired.
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
Find the arc length of the graph of $y=\ln \cos x$ on $[0,\frac{\pi}{4}]$.
::: 

::: {.solution }
First we find that $y'=-\tan x$. 
Now we apply the Arc Length Formula to find
\begin{align*}
L & = \int_0^{\pi/4} \sqrt{1+(-\tan x)^2}\, dx
 = \int_0^{\pi/4} \sec x \, dx \\
& = \int_0^{\pi/4} \sec x \left(\frac{\sec x+\tan x}{\sec x+\tan x} \right) \, dx.
\end{align*}
Now to continue we let $u =\sec x+\tan x$. 
Then we find $du = (\sec x \tan x+\sec^2 x)\, dx$ and so we find the arc length as
\begin{align*}
L & = \int_1^{1+\sqrt{2}} \left(\frac{1}{u}\right) \, du = \ln (1+\sqrt{2})
\end{align*}
as desired.
::: 

Switching the roles of $x$ and $y$, we obtain the arc length for a smooth curve having the form $x=g(y)$. 

::: {#thm- } \label{Arc Length II}
If $x=f(y)$ is a smooth curve on the interval $[c,d]$, then the arc length $L$ of this curve over $[c,d]$ is given as 
\begin{equation}
L=\int_c^d \sqrt{1+[g'(y)]^2}\, dy.
\label{arclengtheq}
\end{equation}
::: 


::: {#exm- } 
Find the exact arc length of the curve $x=\frac{1}{8}y^4+\frac{1}{4}y^{-2}$ over the interval $y=1$ to $y=4$.
::: 

::: {.solution }
Let $x=g(y)=\frac{1}{8}y^4+\frac{1}{4}y^{-2}$ and notice that $g'(y)= \frac{1}{8} y^2-2y^{-2}$ and so 
\begin{align*}
L & = \int_1^4 \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{1}{4}y^6 -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}y^{-6}\right)}\, dy \\
& = \int_1^4 \left(\frac{1}{2}y^3+\frac{1}{2} y^{-3}\right) \, dy
= \frac{2055}{64}
\end{align*}
as desired.
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
Find the arc length of the curve given by $y=\ln(x-\sqrt{x^2-1})$, for $1\leq x \leq \sqrt{2}$ by integrating wth respect to $y$. ::: 

::: {.solution }
Notice that $e^y=x-\sqrt{x^2-1}$. 
Also notice that 
\begin{equation}
e^{-y} = \frac{1}{x-\sqrt{x^2-1}} = \frac{1}{x-\sqrt{x^2-1}} \left(\frac{x+\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x+\sqrt{x^2-1}}\right)
\end{equation}
We obtain $e^{-y} = x+\sqrt{x^2-1}$.
Now by adding $e^y$ and $e^{-y}$, we obtain $x=\frac{1}{2}(e^y +e^{-y})$. 
Therefore, $\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{e^y-e^{-y}}{2}$ and so the arc length is
\begin{align*}
L & = \int_{\ln(\sqrt{2}-1)}^0 \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{e^y-e^{-y}}{2}\right)^2}\, dy 
= \left.\left(\frac{e^y-e^{-y}}{2}\right)\right|^0_{\ln (\sqrt{2}-1)} = 1
\end{align*}
as desired.

## Surfaces of Revolution

::: {#thm- } \label{Surface Area}
Let $f$ be a nonnegative smooth function on $[a,b]$. 
The \index{surface area} **surface area**  of the surface obtained by revolving the graph of $f$ about the $x$-axis is
\begin{equation}
S=2\pi \int_a^b f(x) \sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2} \, dx.
\end{equation}
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
Find the surface area generated by revolving the curve $y= \sqrt{2x-x^2}$ on $0.5\leq x \leq 1.5$. 
::: 

::: {.solution }
We have $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1-x}{\sqrt{2x-x^2}}$ and so using the Surface Area Theorem we have 
\begin{align*}
S & = \int_{0.5}^{1.5} 2\pi \sqrt{2x-x^2} \sqrt{1+\frac{(1-x)^2}{2x-x^2}}\, dx \\
& = 2\pi \int_{0.5}^{1.5}  \sqrt{2x-x^2} \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x-x^2+1-2x+x^2}}{\sqrt{2x-x^2}}\right) \, dx \\
& = 2\pi \int_{0.5}^{1.5} \, dx = 2\pi
\end{align*}
as desired. 
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
Verify that the surface area of a spher of radius $r$ is $S=4\pi r^2$ by evaluating a definite integral. 
::: 

::: {.solution }
Let $y=\sqrt{r^2-x^2}$. 
Then $y'=-\frac{x}{\sqrt{r^2-x^2}}$ and so 
\begin{equation}
1+(y')^2 = \frac{r}{r^2-x^2}. 
\end{equation}
Therefore we find that 
\begin{equation}
S = 2\pi \int_{-r}^r y \left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{r^2-x^2}}\right)\, dx = 2\pi r \int_{-r}^r \, dx = 4\pi r^2
\end{equation}
as desired. 
::: 


::: {#thm- } \label{Surface Area II}
Let $g$ be a nonnegative smooth function on $[c,d]$. 
The \index{surface area} **surface area**  of the surface obtained by revolving the graph of $g$ about the $y$-axis is
\begin{equation}
S=2\pi \int_c^d f(y) \sqrt{1+[g'(y)]^2} \, dy.
\end{equation}
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
Find the area of the surface obtained by revolving the curve 
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{1}{6} y^3+\frac{1}{2y}
\end{equation}
for $1\leq y \leq 2$ about the $y$-axis. 
::: 

::: {.solution }
Notice that $x'=\frac{y^4-1}{2y^2}$ and so 
\begin{equation}
1 +  (x')^2 = 1+\frac{(y^4-1)^2}{4y^4} = \frac{(y^4+1)^2}{4y^4}
\end{equation}
Using the Surface Area Theorem we find the surface area to be
\begin{align*}
S & = \pi \int_1^2 \left(\frac{y^3}{6}+\frac{1}{2y}\right)\left(y^2+\frac{1}{y^2}\right) \, dy \\
& = \pi \int_1^2 \left(\frac{y^5}{6}+\frac{2y}{3}+\frac{1}{2y^3}\right) \, dy = \frac{47\pi}{16}
\end{align*}
as desired.
