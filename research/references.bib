  abstract={Do you need help getting started as an individual or as a member of a group facing the need to prepare formal documents? This is an all-out attack on the problem of teaching people the art of mathematical writing. Learn how others have made use of student assistants in ways that benefit all parties. Read how feedback from students supplies early warning signals from instructors, as well as helping students clarify their thought processes. This book will give aid and encouragement to those wishing to teach a course in technical writing, or to those who wish to write themselves.}

  abstract= {This classic guide contains four essays on writing mathematical books and papers at the research level and at the level of graduate texts. The authors are all well known for their writing skills, as well as their mathematical accomplishments. The first essay, by Steenrod, discusses writing books, either monographs or textbooks. He gives both general and specific advice, getting into such details as the need for a good introduction. The longest essay is by Halmos, and contains many of the pieces of his advice that are repeated even today: In order to say something well you must have something to say; write for someone; think about the alphabet. Halmos's advice is systematic and practical.}

  abstract = {The subject of mathematical writing has been infused with life once again by Nick Higham as he follows up his successful HWMS volume with this much-anticipated second edition. As is Higham's style, the material is enlivened by anecdotes, unusual paper titles, and humorous quotations. This handy new volume provides even more information on the issues you will face when writing a technical paper or talk, from choosing the right journal in which to publish to handling your references. Its overview of the entire publication process is invaluable for anyone hoping to publish in a technical journal. The original book has been completely revised, making use of feedback from readers as well as Higham's own large file of ideas based on his experiences in reading, writing, editing, examining, and supervising theses.}

There are now electronic-only journals and print-on-demand books, Open Access journals and joint research projects such as MathOverflow—not to mention a host of other new realities. It truly is a brave new world, one that can be overwhelming and confusing. The truly new feature of this second edition is an extensive discussion of technological developments. Similar to the first edition, Krantz's frank and straightforward approach makes this book particularly suitable as a textbook for an undergraduate course.}

abstract = {Mathematics support on the web is currently very limited mainly due to the lack of browser support for the dedicated markup language MathML. While for visual display JavaScript libraries like MathJax can ensure flawless rendering of formulas across all platforms and browsers, there currently exists no system independent assistive technology solutions for Mathematics. We report on the attempt to transform MathJax into a universal rendering solution, providing accessibility also for readers with visual, print, and motor impairments. As our goal is to integrate seamlessly with other assistive technology solutions, we are faced with a number of technical challenges to provide a consistent user experience, regardless of the particular combination of platform, browser, and screen reader employed by readers. This paper presents MathJax's accessibility features and some of the technical challenges to motivate a wish-list for future standards to enhance web accessibility for STEM content.},

  abstract={In the last two decades that there has been an explosion in the use of web applications. Given the ever-expanding number of web and mobile apps, extensive work has been done in developing and using efficient core technologies to support the performance goals of the apps. In particular, front-end developer languages such as Javascript are highly popular. In this paper, we perform a detailed study of the recently introduced Python-based web development framework PyScript and evaluate the performance of PyScript in comparison with Javascript using standard benchmarks. The research contributions of this work are in the benchmarking of code in three different categories (i) DOM manipulation, (ii) Operations involving the network layer, and (iii)cpu-intensive computations. The benchmarks come from one of the standards and carefully implemented to perform a comparative evaluation. Results show that native Javascript code runs faster on all DOM and networking sets of benchmarks by a factor of 1.5 to 5 when compared with PyScript, with the exception of two of the networking benchmarks. It is in the computationally intensive benchmarks that Javascript trumps PyScript by a factor of 25 to 35 depending the algorithm. We offer architectural insights into performance issues and conclude with directions on further research.},

Before being available to all projects in December 2020, it had been tested on selected open source software projects. To understand how developers use this novel feature, how they perceive it, and how it impacts the development processes, we conducted a mixed-methods study based on early adopters of GitHub discussions from January until July 2020.}
