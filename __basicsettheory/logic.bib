  abstract = {The new edition of this classic textbook, Introduction to Mathematical Logic, Sixth Edition explores the principal topics of mathematical logic. It covers propositional logic, first-order logic, first-order number theory, axiomatic set theory, and the theory of computability. The text also discusses the major results of Gödel, Church, Kleene, Rosser, and Turing. The sixth edition incorporates recent work on Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem as well as restoring an appendix on consistency proofs for first-order arithmetic. This appendix last appeared in the first edition. It is offered in the new edition for historical considerations. The text also offers historical perspectives and many new exercises of varying difficulty, which motivate and lead students to an in-depth, practical understanding of the material.}

  year={2018},
  publisher={CRC Press},
  abstract = {This introductory graduate text covers modern mathematical logic from propositional, first-order and infinitary logic and Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems to extensive introductions to set theory, model theory and recursion (computability) theory. Based on the author's more than 35 years of teaching experience, the book develops students' intuition by presenting complex ideas in the simplest context for which they make sense. The book is appropriate for use as a classroom text, for self-study, and as a reference on the state of modern logic.}

  abstract = {From the reviews: "A good textbook can improve a lecture course enormously, especially when the material of the lecture includes many technical details. Van Dalen's book, the success and popularity of which may be suspected from this steady interest in it, contains a thorough introduction to elementary classical logic in a relaxed way, suitable for mathematics students who just want to get to know logic. The presentation always points out the connections of logic to other parts of mathematics. The reader immediately see the logic is "just another branch of mathematics" and not something more sacred."}

  url={https://books.google.com/books?id=mVeTuaRwWssC},
  year={2003},
  publisher={Cambridge University Press},
  abstract = {This is an introduction to logic and the axiomatization of set theory from a unique standpoint. Philosophical considerations, which are often ignored or treated casually, are here given careful consideration, and furthermore the author places the notion of inductively defined sets (recursive datatypes) at the center of his exposition resulting in a treatment of well established topics that is fresh and insightful. The presentation is engaging, but always great care is taken to illustrate difficult points. Understanding is also aided by the inclusion of many exercises. Little previous knowledge of logic is required of the reader, and only a background of standard undergraduate mathematics is assumed.}

  publisher={American Mathematical Society},
  abstract = {Here is an introduction to modern logic that differs from others by treating logic from an algebraic perspective. What this means is that notions and results from logic become much easier to understand when seen from a familiar standpoint of algebra. The presentation, written in the engaging and provocative style that is the hallmark of Paul Halmos, from whose course the book is taken, is aimed at a broad audience, students, teachers and amateurs in mathematics, philosophy, computer science, linguistics and engineering; they all have to get to grips with logic at some stage. All that is needed.}

  publisher={Cambridge University Press},
  abstract = {This is a highly accessible guide to the fundamental aims and basic elements of formal logic. Peter Smith introduces the reader to the languages of propositional and predicate logic, and then develops formal systems for evaluating arguments translated into these languages, concentrating on the easily comprehensible 'tree' method. His discussion is richly illustrated with worked examples and exercises, and also provides provides illuminating philosophical commentary. It will make an ideal text for a first logic course, and will provide a firm basis for further work in formal and philosophical logic.}

  abstract = {At the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, mathematical logic examines the power and limitations of formal mathematical thinking. In this expansion of Leary's user-friendly 1st edition, readers with no previous study in the field are introduced to the basics of model theory, proof theory, and computability theory. The text is designed to be used either in an upper division undergraduate classroom, or for self study. Updating the 1st Edition's treatment of languages, structures, and deductions, leading to rigorous proofs of Gödel's First and Second Incompleteness Theorems, the expanded 2nd Edition includes a new introduction to incompleteness through computability as well as solutions to selected exercises.}
