  abstract= {This best-selling textbook for a second course in linear algebra is aimed at undergrad math majors and graduate students. The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra.}

  abstract = {In the second edition of this popular and successful text the number of exercises has been drastically increased (to a minimum of 25 per chapter); also a new chapter on the Jordan normal form has been added. These changes do not affect the character of the book as a compact but mathematically clean introduction to linear algebra with particular emphasis on topics that are used in the theory of differential equations.}

  abstract = {Linear algebra is relatively easy for students during the early stages of the course, when the material is presented in a familiar, concrete setting. But when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a brick wall. Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations), are not easily understood, and require time to assimilate. Since they are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, students' understanding of these concepts is vital to their mastery of the subject. David Lay introduces these concepts early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting, develops them gradually, and returns to them again and again throughout the text so that when discussed in the abstract, these concepts are more ac...}

  abstract = {This text covers a standard first course: Gauss's Method, vector spaces, linear maps and matrices, determinants, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In addition, each chapter ends with some brief topics, such as applications. What sets it apart is careful motivation, many examples, and extensive exercise sets. Together, these help each student master the material of the course and also help an instructor develop that student's level of mathematical maturity.}

  abstract = {Jordan Canonical Form (JCF) is one of the most important, and useful, concepts in linear algebra. The JCF of a linear transformation, or of a matrix, encodes all of the structural information about that linear transformation, or matrix. This book is a careful development of JCF. After beginning with background material, we introduce Jordan Canonical Form and related notions: eigenvalues, (generalized) eigenvectors, and the characteristic and minimum polynomials. We decide the question of diagonalizability, and prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. Then we present a careful and complete proof of the fundamental theorem.}

Applications have increased not only in quantity but also in diversity, with linear systems being used to solve problems in chemistry, engineering, economics, nutrition, urban planning, and more. DeFranza and Gagliardi introduce students to the topic in a clear, engaging, and easy-to-follow manner. Topics are developed fully before moving on to the next through a series of natural connections. The result is a solid introduction to linear algebra for undergraduatesâ€™ first course.}
