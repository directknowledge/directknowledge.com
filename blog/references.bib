  abstract={Do you need help getting started as an individual or as a member of a group facing the need to prepare formal documents? This is an all-out attack on the problem of teaching people the art of mathematical writing. Learn how others have made use of student assistants in ways that benefit all parties. Read how feedback from students supplies early warning signals from instructors, as well as helping students clarify their thought processes. This book will give aid and encouragement to those wishing to teach a course in technical writing, or to those who wish to write themselves.}

  isbn={9780821896785},
  url={https://books.google.com/books?id=6UypbkweqiwC},
  year={1973},
  publisher={American Mathematical Soc.},
  abstract= {This classic guide contains four essays on writing mathematical books and papers at the research level and at the level of graduate texts. The authors are all well known for their writing skills, as well as their mathematical accomplishments. The first essay, by Steenrod, discusses writing books, either monographs or textbooks. He gives both general and specific advice, getting into such details as the need for a good introduction. The longest essay is by Halmos, and contains many of the pieces of his advice that are repeated even today: In order to say something well you must have something to say; write for someone; think about the alphabet. Halmos's advice is systematic and practical.}

  abstract = {Today the internet virtually consumes all of our lives (especially the lives of writers). As both readers and writers, we are all aware of blogs, chat rooms, and preprint servers. There are now electronic-only journals and print-on-demand books, Open Access journals and joint research projects such as MathOverflowâ€”not to mention a host of other new realities. It truly is a brave new world, one that can be overwhelming and confusing. The truly new feature of this second edition is an extensive discussion of technological developments. Similar to the first edition, Krantz's frank and straightforward approach makes this book particularly suitable as a textbook for an undergraduate course.}

abstract = {Mathematics support on the web is currently very limited mainly due to the lack of browser support for the dedicated markup language MathML. While for visual display JavaScript libraries like MathJax can ensure flawless rendering of formulas across all platforms and browsers, there currently exists no system independent assistive technology solutions for Mathematics. We report on the attempt to transform MathJax into a universal rendering solution, providing accessibility also for readers with visual, print, and motor impairments. As our goal is to integrate seamlessly with other assistive technology solutions, we are faced with a number of technical challenges to provide a consistent user experience, regardless of the particular combination of platform, browser, and screen reader employed by readers. This paper presents MathJax's accessibility features and some of the technical challenges to motivate a wish-list for future standards to enhance web accessibility for STEM content.},
