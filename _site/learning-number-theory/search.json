After that, we cover linear, quadratic, and polynomial congruence equations. While studying these topics we’ll also learn how to use python. In the second part, we introduce automating proofs in elementary number theory using python. We’ll do this by first studying Grobner Bases in polynomial rings and then making a connection between these rings and theorems involving integer divisibility."

Then \\(s(z)+v<z\\) and so \\(x=z+v<s(z+v)=s(z)+v<z\\). By induction hypothesis \\(x>z\\). Therefore, this case cannot happen either. All cases considered, it now follows that \\(t>s(z)\\).

    "text": "1.3 Mathematical Induction\nNow it’s time to take a closer look at the principle of mathematical induction and see how it works. Then we’ll explore some examples so that you can get a better understanding of this important principle.\nMathematical induction is a principle that allows us to prove a theorem by assuming that the theorem is true for a certain value of a variable and then demonstrating that the theorem holds for all larger values of the variable. This principle is incredibly important in mathematics and can be used to solve problems both big and small.\nBut, mathematical induction is challenging, especially for beginners. That’s why I made this article and video series so you can become skilled. So let’s start learning about mathematical induction.\nThe idea behind mathematical induction (or just induction) is simple: we prove that the statement holds for the first element in a well-ordered set (this is called the base case), and then we prove that if the statement holds for any given element in the set, it must also hold for the next element in the set (this is called the inductive step). By showing these two steps, the base case and the inductive step, it follows by mathematical induction that the statement holds for all elements in the set.\nThis process can be used to prove statements involving natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers; and is basically used throughout mathematics.\nThe most basic form of mathematical induction is called natural induction. This type of induction can be used to prove statements involving the natural numbers \\[\\mathbb{N}=\\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\}.\\] To use natural induction, we first need to prove the statement for the first natural number, which is 0. This is called the base case.\nOn the other hand, we also use mathematical induction to prove statements involving the positive integers \\[\\mathbb{Z}^+ =\\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}.\\] In using this method, the base case is at 1. Now whichever of these two methods you wish to use, the next step is the same.\nNext, we assume that the statement is true for some number \\(n.\\) This is called the induction hypothesis. Finally, we must prove that the statement is also true for the next number, \\(n+1.\\) This is called the induction step. If we can successfully complete these two steps (base case) and inductive step), then we have written a mathematical proof based on the principle of mathematical induction. For more on mathematical induction see (Davenport 2008, 6–8).\nDoes this sound confusing yet? Well, we have just begun. So let’s go into more detail.\nWhat is mathematical induction and why is it useful in proofs? Mathematical induction is a method of mathematical proof that is used to establish a given statement for all natural numbers. In other words, it allows us to prove statements about infinitely many objects (such as natural numbers) by proving them for just one object, and then using that result to prove the statement for the next object, and so on. Here is the full statement of mathematical induction (Burton 2006, 2–6):\nMathematical Induction. If \\(P\\) is a subset of the natural numbers with the following properties:\n\n\\(0 \\in P,\\) and\nfor all \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N},\\) \\(k \\in P\\) implies \\(k+1 \\in P,\\)\n\nthen \\(P\\) is the set of natural numbers.\nNotice that this statement is an implication, containing two sub-statements, the second of which is an implication.\nTo use mathematical induction to prove a statement, we first need to prove two things:\n\nThe statement is true for the first natural number.\nIf the statement is true for some natural number \\(k\\), then it is also true for \\(k+1.\\)\n\nIf both of these things can be proven, then the statement is true for all natural numbers. Notice that the second statement is where the difficulty lies, mostly because it is an implication. More on this in a moment.\nHere are three examples where a proof by mathematical induction can be used.\n\nProof that \\(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2\\) for all natural numbers \\(n.\\) (see dasmith2021_2?)\nProof that every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be written as a product of prime numbers. (see Rosen 2005, 108 – 110)\nProof that the Fibonacci sequence \\(F(n)\\) satisfies the formula \\[F(n+1) F(n-1) - F(n)^2 = (-1)^n\\] for all natural numbers \\(n\\). (see asmith2022Fib?)\n\nWe will begin proving statements using mathematical induction after mentioning a few applications, in the next lecture.\nOne of the most important applications of mathematical induction is in combinatorics, where it is used to prove statements about counting objects (such as the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from a set of \\(n\\)). To be clear though, mathematical induction is used throughout sciences, engineering, and humanities, i.e. (see William 2016).\n\nIn computer science, mathematical induction is used to design algorithms that work for all inputs of a certain size or larger.\nIn physics and engineering, mathematical induction is used to derive formulas for the sum of infinitely many terms in a series.\nIn mathematics, induction is used to prove statements about sets of numbers, such as integers or real numbers.\nIn economics, induction is used to study optimal behavior in situations where agents have incomplete information.\nInduction is also used in philosophy, for example, to justify the belief that the future will be like the past.\nIn linguistics, mathematical induction is used to study the structure of language.\nIn biology, mathematical induction is used to study the behavior of populations over time.\n\nThis list is just a few applications, to be clear, mathematical induction is ubiquitous.\nNow in order to understand mathematical induction we need to work out some examples. Lots of examples and exercises.\nMathematical induction (induction) is important because it allows us to prove statements that are true for all natural numbers. This means that we can use induction to prove statements about infinite sets, which is something difficult to do. To be clear, mathematical induction provides a rigorous method of proving mathematical statements involving infinite sets of numbers.\nMathematical induction is the following statement:\n\nIf \\(P\\) is a subset of the natural numbers with the properties:\n\n\\(0 \\in P\\), and\nfor all \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(k \\in P\\) implies \\(k+1 \\in P\\),\n\nthen \\(P\\) is the set of the natural numbers.\n\nThe advantage of mathematical induction is that it gives us a procedure to change the is a subset in the hypothesis to is the set in the conclusion. Before understanding the foundations of mathematical induction (later in this series), let’s work through some examples and see how it works.\nWe will now look at some examples of how to use mathematical induction.\n\nExample 1.1 Prove that for all natural numbers \\(n\\),\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{addsum}\n\\sum_{i=0}^n i =\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(P\\) be the set of natural numbers for which \\(\\eqref{addsum}\\) is true. Since \\(0=0=0(1)/2\\) we see that \\(0\\in P.\\) Assume \\(k\\in P.\\) Then we find,\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=0}^{k+1} i\n& =\\sum_{i=0}^{k} i+(k+1) \\label{twostep}\\\\[8pt]\n& =\\frac{k(k+1)}{2} +(k+1) \\label{threestep} \\\\[8pt]\n& =\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhich shows \\(k+1\\in P.\\) By mathematical induction \\(P=\\mathbb{N}\\) as desired. \\(\\square\\)\n\nNotice that the induction hypothesis is used in moving from steps \\(\\eqref{twostep}\\) to \\(\\eqref{threestep}\\).\nIn the next example, I leave out the reference to the set \\(P\\). Also notice that I start the base case at 1 and use the set of positive integers.\n\nExample 1.2 Prove that \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{squares}\n\\sum _{i=1}^n i^2=\\frac{n(2n+1)(n+1)}{6}\n\\end{equation}\\] for all positive integers \\(n.\\)\n\n\nSolution. For \\(n=1,\\) \\[\\begin{equation}\n1=\\sum _{i=1}^1 i^2=\\frac{1(2+1)(1+1)}{6}=1\n\\end{equation}\\] and so the base case holds. Assume that \\(\\eqref{squares}\\) is true for some positive integer \\(k,\\) we need to show that \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\sum _{i=1}^{k+1} i^2=\\frac{(k+1)(2k+2)(k+2)}{6}\n\\end{equation}\\] holds. We have\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum _{i=1}^{k+1} i^2\n& =(k+1)^2+\\sum _{i=1}^k i^2 \\\\[8pt]\n& =(k+1)^2+\\frac{k(2k+1)(k+1)}{6} \\\\[8pt]\n& =\\frac{(k+1)(2k+2)(k+2)}{6}.\n\\end{align}\\]\nTherefore, by mathematical induction \\(\\eqref{squares}\\) holds for all positive integers \\(n.\\) \\(\\square\\)\n\nThe next example also demonstrates how to use mathematical induction.\nNotice in this example, that we define a set of numbers with the intent of showing that this subset of natural numbers is in fact the entire set of natural numbers. We do this in two steps. First, we verify the base case. For the second step, using an induction hypothesis, we verify the needed implication. The final statement is simply the conclusion that this subset of natural numbers \\(P\\) is in fact the entire set of natural numbers.\n\nExample 1.3 Prove that, for all natural numbers \\(n\\), \\(2^n>n.\\)\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(P\\) be the set of all natural numbers for which \\(2^n>n\\) is true. Since \\(2^0=1>0\\) is true, \\(0\\in P.\\) Assume \\(k\\in P\\) and \\(k>0\\). Then \\(2^k>k\\) is true and since\n\\[\\begin{align}\n2^{k+1} & = 2^k\\cdot 2 \\\\[8pt]\n& > k \\cdot 2  \\\\[8pt]  \n& = k+k  \\\\[8pt]\n& > k+1\n\\end{align}\\]\nit follows \\(k+1\\in P.\\) Thus, for all \\(k\\in P\\), \\(k\\in P\\) implies \\(k+1\\in P\\) is true and so by mathematical induction \\(P=\\mathbb{N}\\) as desired. \\(\\square\\)\n\nAnd there we have it our first three examples. We will have several more examples to come.\nBut first you should checkout the well-ordering principle."

    "section": "1.4 The Well-Ordering Principle",
    "text": "1.4 The Well-Ordering Principle\nThe well-ordering principle (also called the well-ordering axiom) for the natural numbers is important because it provides a way to order the natural numbers. This ordering can be used to prove mathematical statements about the natural numbers. For example, the well-ordering principle can be used to show that every natural number has a unique successor. This fact can then be used to prove that there are no infinite descending sequences of natural numbers.\nOne answer is to simply use the order in which they are defined, so that \\(0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < 4\\) and so on. However, we are looking for an ordering in the sense of being antisymmetric and transitive.\n\nDefinition 1.3 The relation \\(\\leq\\) defined on \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) by, for all \\(m,n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\),\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nm\\leq n \\Longleftrightarrow \\exists p \\in \\mathbb{N}:\n\\, m+p=n.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nWe call \\(\\leq\\) an ordering because it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.\nLet’s see why. If \\(m\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), then \\(m +0 = m\\) and so \\(m\\leq m\\) by definition of \\(\\leq\\). In other words \\(p=0\\) and so \\(\\leq\\) is reflexive.\nNotice the ordering is antisymmetric also. To see this suppose that \\(m\\leq n\\) and \\(n\\leq m\\). Then there exists \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) such that \\(m+p_1 = n\\) and \\(n+p_2 = m\\). From this we see that \\(m=n\\) because\n\\[\\begin{align}\nm+p_1 & = (n+p_2)+p_1 \\\\[8pt]\n& = n + (p_1+p_2) \\\\[8pt]\n& = n\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhich yields that \\(p_1=p_2=0\\).\nFinally to show that \\(\\leq\\) is transitive just assume that \\(r\\leq s\\) and \\(s\\leq t\\) where \\(r,s,t\\) are natural numbers. Then there exists \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) such that \\(r+p_1 = s\\) and \\(s+p_2 = t\\). From this we see that\n\\[\\begin{align}\nr + (p_1 + p_2) & = (r+p_1) +p_2 \\\\[8pt]\n& = s + p_2 \\\\[8pt]\n& = t\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhich yields that \\(r\\leq t\\).\nThe well-ordering principle is the simple claim that:\n\nevery nonempty set of positive integers has a least element.\n\nThis sometimes overlooked and obvious statement will be proven to be logically equivalent to mathematical induction, in a later tutorial. To be clear, though, it can not be proven using the familiar properties satisfied by the integers under addition and multiplication.\nFor now, let’s consider some examples.\n\nExample 1.4 Find the smallest element in each subset of \\(\\mathbb{N}\\).\n\n\\(A=\\\\{n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\mid n \\text{ is prime }\\\\}\\)\n\\(B=\\\\{n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\text{ $n$ is a multiple of 7}\\\\}\\)\n\\(C=\\\\{n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\text{ $n=110-7m$ for some $m\\in \\mathbb{Z}$}\\\\}\\)\n\\(D=\\\\{n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\text{ $n=12s+18t$ for some $s,t\\in \\mathbb{Z}$}\\\\}\\)\n\n\n\nSolution. The smallest prime is 2. The smallest positive multiple of 7 is 7. As \\(m\\) takes on the values \\(1,2,3,\\ldots\\), then values of \\(n\\) form the sequence \\[ 93, 76, 59, \\ldots, 8, -9 ,\\ldots \\] Hence the smallest element of \\(C\\) is 8. Notice that \\(12s+18t=6(2s+3t)\\) and so elements of \\(D\\) are multiples of \\(6\\). In fact, \\(6=(12)(-1)+18(1)\\) and so \\(6\\) is in \\(D\\). Since 6 is the smallest positive multiple of 6, we see that \\(6\\) is the least element of \\(D\\). \\(\\square\\)\n\nIn other words, no matter how a subset of natural numbers is defined, as long as it is nonempty, the Well-Ordering Principle guarantees us, that it must have a least element.\nOn the one hand, the Well-Ordering Principle seems like an obvious statement, and on the other hand, the Principal of Mathematical Induction is an incredibly useful method of proof. In a later article we’ll be proving this theorem here.\n\nTheorem 1.2 The following statements are equivalent.\n\n(Well-Ordering Axiom) Every nonempty set of positive integers has a least element.\n(Mathematical Induction) If \\(P\\) is a subset of the positive integers with the following properties: 1) \\(0 \\in P\\), and 2) for all \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(k \\in P\\) implies \\(k+1 \\in P\\), then \\(P\\) is the set of positive integers.\n\n\nNotice in the proof of the following theorem, that the well-ordering principle is used. \n\nTheorem 1.3 If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers, then there exists a positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n a \\geq b.\\)\n\n\nProof. Assume for a contradiction that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) do not satisfy the statement; that is, assume there exists positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(n a< b\\) for every positive integer \\(n.\\) Consider the set,\n\\[S=\\{b-n a \\, | \\, n \\text{ is a positive integer}\\}\\]\nwhich consists only of positive integers. By the well-ordering principle, \\(S\\) possess a least element, say \\(b-m a\\) for some positive integer \\(m.\\) However, \\(b-(m+1)a\\) is in \\(S\\) and \\(b-(m+1)a\\) is less than \\(b-m a\\) by\n\\[ b-(m+1)a=(b-m a)-a<b-m a.\\]\nTherefore, for positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) there must exist a positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n a\\geq b.\\) \\(\\square\\)\n\nRemark. Can the reader prove that the Archimedean Property implies the Well-Ordering Principle?\nLater, we will use the Well-Ordering Principle to prove the Division Algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Before, we get to these theorems though, let’s practice using mathematical induction.\nWhen proving a statement by mathematical induction, you should look for a pattern in the statement that can be used to create a base case and an inductive case. The base case is the simplest version of the statement, and the inductive case is a more complicated version of the statement that builds on the base case. You can then use mathematical induction to justify that the statement holds true for all cases.\nIn our first example, we are proving that\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)=n^2\\]\nfor all positive integers \\(n\\). For example, notice that\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^1 (2i-1) = 1 = 1^2\\]\nso the base case holds for \\(n=1\\) (i.e. the first positive integer). However, to demonstrate that sometimes a change in the index is desired, we show how to accomplish this. \n\nExample 1.5 Prove that for all natural numbers \\(n\\), \\[\\sum_{i=0}^n (2i+1)=(n+1)^2. \\qquad(1.1)\\]\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(P\\) be the set of natural numbers for which (Equation 1.1) is true, that is\n\\[P=\\left\\{n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid  \\sum_{i=0}^n (2i+1)=(n+1)^2 \\right\\}.\\]\nThe basis step is easily verified by\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^0 (2i+1) = 1 = 1^2\\]\nand so we see \\(0\\in P\\). For an induction hypothesis, assume \\(k\\in P\\). Then\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^k (2i+1)=(k+1)^2\\]\nis true and thus,\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=0}^{k+1} (2i+1)\n& =\\sum_{i=0}^{k} (2i+1)+(2(k+1)+1) \\\\\n& =(k+1)^2+2k+3 \\\\\n& =(k+2)^2\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhich shows \\(k+1\\in P\\). By mathematical induction, \\(P=\\mathbb{N}\\) as desired. \\(\\square\\)\n\nIn our next example, we work with an alternating sum.\n\nExample 1.6 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n\\), \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^i \\, i = \\frac{(-1)^n (2n+1)-1}{4}  \\qquad(1.2)\\]\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(P\\) be the set of positive integers for which (Equation 1.2) is true. The basis step is easily verified by\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^1 (-1)^i \\, i = -1 = \\frac{(-1)^1 (2(1)+1)-1}{4}\\]\nand so we see \\(1\\in P\\). For an induction hypothesis, assume \\(k\\in P\\). Then\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^i \\, i = \\frac{(-1)^k (2k+1)-1}{4}\\]\nis true and thus,\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (-1)^i \\, i\n& = \\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^i \\, i + (-1)^{k+1} (k+1)  \\\\\n& =\\frac{(-1)^k (2k+1)-1}{4} + (-1)^{k+1} (k+1) \\\\\n& = \\frac{(-1)^{k+1} (2(k+1)+1)-1}{4}\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhich shows \\(k+1\\in P\\). By mathematical induction \\(P=\\mathbb{Z}^+\\) as desired. \\(\\square\\)\n\nIn this next example, we work with an inequality, showing that exponential growth is greater than linear growth.\n\nExample 1.7 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n\\), \\(3^n > 3n-1\\).\n\n\nSolution. If \\(n=1\\), then \\(3^1 = 3 > 2 = 3(1)-1\\) so the base case holds. Let \\(k\\) be a positive integer and assume that \\(3^k > 3k-1\\). Then\n\\[3^{k+1} = 3^k \\cdot 3 > (3k-1) \\cdot 3 \\geq 3k+2 = 3(k+1) -1.\\]\nSo the result follows by mathematical induction. \\(\\square\\)\n\nNow let’s generalize the previous example.\n\nExample 1.8 Let \\(x\\) be any real number greater than \\(-1\\). Use mathematical induction to prove that \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{polyind}\n(1+x)^n \\geq 1 + nx\n\\end{equation}\\] for all positive integers \\(n\\).\n\n\nSolution. If \\(n=1\\), then \\((1+x)^1\\geq 1 + (1) x\\) and so the base case holds. Let \\(k\\) be a positive integer and assume that \\((1+x)^k \\geq 1+kx\\). Then\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(1+x)^{k+1}\n& = (1+x)^{k} (1+x)   \\\\\n& \\geq (1+kx)(1+x) \\\\\n& = 1+x+k x +k x^2 \\\\\n& = 1+ (k+1)x +kx^2 \\\\\n& \\geq 1+ (k+1)x\n\\end{align}\\]\nbecause \\(x^2\\geq 0\\) and \\(k\\geq 0\\). So the result follows by mathematical induction. \\(\\square\\)\n\nIn our fifth example, we have a sum of the reciprocals of squares involved with an inequality. These types of inequalities can be very useful in other subjects such as analysis.\n\nExample 1.9 Prove that for all integers \\(n\\geq 1\\), \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{squarerec}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{i^2} \\leq 2 -\\frac{1}{n}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nSolution. If \\(n=1\\), then \\(\\sum_{i=1}^1 \\frac{1}{1^2} = 1\\leq 2 -\\frac{1}{1}\\) and so the base case holds. Let \\(k\\) be a positive integer and assume that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{i^2} \\leq 2 -\\frac{1}{k}\\). Then\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \\frac{1}{i^2}\n& = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{i^2}  + \\frac{1}{(k+1)^2}  \\\\\n& \\leq 2 - \\frac{1}{k}  + \\frac{1}{(k+1)^2} \\\\\n& \\leq 2 -\\frac{1}{k+1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSo the result follows by mathematical induction. \\(\\square\\)\n\nNow that we’ve seen some examples, let’s go for a deeper understanding of mathematical induction.\nNow we will demonstrate the usefulness of mathematical induction by providing rigorous proofs for the summation formulas for finite sums of arithmetic and geometric progressions.\nArithmetic progressions are found all around us in nature and in everyday life. The temperature on a day might rise steadily from morning until evening, for instance. Or the population of a town might grow gradually over time. The study of arithmetic progressions has many practical applications. Businesses use them to forecast future sales, for example. And mathematicians use them to solve problems in physics and other areas of mathematics.\n\nDefinition 1.4 A sequence of the form \\(a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots, a+nd, \\ldots\\) where \\(a,d\\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is called an arithmetic progression.\n\nFor example, if \\(a=0\\) and \\(d=1\\), then the sequence is \\(0,1,2,3,4,\\ldots\\), in other words the natural numbers. Or let’s say, \\(a=1/2\\) and \\(d=-2\\), then the sequence is \\(1/2, -3/2, -7/2, -11/2, -15/2,\\) and so on.\nIn the following example, we prove a wonderful formula for the sum of the terms in arithmetic progression. \n\nExample 1.10 Let \\(a,d\\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Prove that for every positive integer \\(n\\), that \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{arithprog} a+(a+d)+\\cdots + (a+nd) =\\frac{(n+1)(2a+nd)}{2}. \\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(P\\) be the set of positive integers for which \\(\\eqref{arithprog}\\) holds. Since\n\\[a+(a+d)=[(1+1)(2a+d)]/2,\\]\nwe see that \\(1\\in P\\). Assume \\(k\\in P\\). We find\n\\[\\begin{align}\n& a+(a+d)+\\cdots + (a+kd) + (a+(k+1) d) \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{(k+1)(2a+kd)}{2} + (a+(k+1) d) \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{(k+1)(2a+kd)+ 2(a+(k+1) d)}{2} \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{(k+2)(2a+(k+1)d)}{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTherefore, \\(k+1\\in P\\) and thus \\(\\eqref{arithprog}\\) holds for \\(n\\geq 1\\), by mathematical induction. \\(\\square\\)\n\nA geometric progression is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed number, called the common ratio. In other words, each number in the sequence is determined by multiplying the previous number by a (fixed) certain amount. Let’s now explore geometric progressions.\n\nDefinition 1.5 Recall a sequence of the form \\(a, ar, ar^2, \\ldots, a r^n, \\ldots\\) where \\(a,r\\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(r\\geq 1\\) is called a geometric progression.\n\nFor example, if \\(a=1\\) and \\(r=2\\), the sequence is \\(1,2,4,8,16,32,\\ldots\\). Or let’s say, \\(a=1/2\\) and \\(r=-2\\), then the sequence is \\(1/2, -1, 2, -4, 8,\\cdots\\) and so on.\n\nExample 1.11 Let \\(a,r\\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and suppose \\(r\\geq 1\\). Prove that, for each positive integer \\(n,\\) that \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{geopro} a+ar+\\cdots +a r^n =a\\left(\\frac{r^{n+1}-1}{r-1}\\right). \\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(P\\) be the set of positive integers for which \\(\\eqref{geopro}\\) holds. Since \\(a+ar=a (r^2-1)/(r-1),\\) we see that \\(1\\in P.\\) Assume \\(k\\in P.\\) We find\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& a+ar +ar^2+\\cdots +a r^k+a r^{k+1} \\\\\n& \\qquad =a\\left(\\frac{r^{k+1}-1}{r-1}\\right)+a r^{k+1} \\\\\n& \\qquad =\\frac{a r^{k+1}-a+(r-1)a r^{k+1} }{r-1} \\\\\n& \\qquad =a\\left(\\frac{r^{k+2}-1}{r-1}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTherefore, \\(k+1\\in P\\) and thus \\(\\eqref{geopro}\\) holds for \\(n\\geq 1\\), by mathematical induction. \\(\\square\\)\nThe mathematical induction principle is analogous to an infinite string of equally spaced dominos set up in a single line arranged so that if one falls down then so does the next one. Imagine you knock down the first domino, and then after some time has passed you check back and the dominos are still falling. Would you believe that this will continue indefinitely?\nThe method of proof of using the principle of mathematical induction is frequently useful in the theory of numbers. Familiarity with this type of argument is essential to subsequent work.\nIn any proof by induction, we must not forget to show that \\(0\\) is in \\(P\\). Even if we show that the truth of \\(k\\) in \\(P\\) implies that \\(k+1\\) is in \\(P\\), if \\(0\\) is not in \\(P,\\) then we cannot conclude that \\(P\\) is the set of natural numbers. For example, let \\(P\\) be the set of all natural numbers that satisfy:\n\\[n+(n+1)=2n. \\qquad(1.3)\\]\nSuppose \\(k\\) satisfies, (Equation 1.3). Using this we have\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n(k+1)+(k+2) & =k+(k+1)+2 \\\\\n& =2k+2 \\\\\n& = 2(k+1)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nand thus \\(k+1\\) also satisfies (Equation 1.3). So, if \\(1\\) satisfies (Equation 1.3) then, it would follow that (Equation 1.3) is true for all natural numbers \\(n\\). However, \\(0\\) does not satisfy (Equation 1.3). In fact, obviously, (Equation 1.3) is false for all natural numbers \\(n\\). We conclude that the basis step is a necessary part of any proof by mathematical induction.\nThe assumption that the statement is true for some number \\(n=k\\) will often be referred to as the induction hypothesis. Sometimes the role that 1 plays in the principle of mathematical induction will be replaced by some other integer, say \\(a,\\) in such instances mathematical induction establishes the statement for all integers \\(n\\geq a.\\)\nThe method of mathematical induction has its limitations in that it consists of testing a known (or conjectured) formula. All that the induction process enables us to do is to show that any special case can be proved on the assumption that all the preceding cases have been verified."

    "text": "1.5 The Mathematical Induction Equivalence\nIn the hypothesis of mathematical induction, the statement \\(0\\in P\\) is called the base case. Mathematical induction can be thought of as a collection of principles, for example, the base case may start at \\(0\\), or \\(1\\), or \\(2\\), etc. instead of \\(0\\). In each of these scenarios, the goal is to prove a collection of statements is true, for all \\(n\\) greater than some initial value which must be verified (base case).\nNow that we have established that a base case is required when using mathematical induction. It is now natural to ask: does the base case need to start at the first natural number 0. We have seen previous examples where that base case starts at 1 when proving a statement holds for all positive integers. So let’s make this formal.\nLet \\(a\\) be a natural number. Consider the set defined by\n\\[\\mathbb{N}_a = \\{k\\in \\mathbb{N}:k\\geq a\\}.\\]\nIn other words,\n\\[\\mathbb{N}_a = \\{a,a+1,a+2,a+3, \\ldots \\}.\\]\nUsing this set notation we can formalize variations of mathematical induction as follows.\nMathematical Induction is the following statement:\n\nLet \\(a\\) be a natural number. If \\(P\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathbb{N}_a\\) with the properties:\n\n\\(a \\in P\\), and\nfor all \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}_a\\), \\(k \\in P\\) implies \\(k+1 \\in P\\),\n\nthen \\(P\\) is the set \\(\\mathbb{N}_a\\).\n\nNotice that whenever \\(a=0\\), we have the Principle of Mathematical Induction as stated previously.\nFor example, while \\(n!>n\\) is not true for $n=0, 1, 2 $, it is true for all \\(n\\geq 3\\). So our base case is \\(n=3\\). Let’s prove that \\(n!>n\\) for all \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since \\(3!=1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3=6>3\\) we see that the base case holds. Now assume that for some positive integer \\(k\\) greater than 3, that \\(k!>k.\\) Then we see that\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n(k+1)! & =k!(k+1) \\\\\n& >k(k+1) \\\\\n& >k+1\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, \\(n!>n\\) for all \\(n\\geq 3\\).\n\nExample 1.12 Prove that \\(2^{n-1}>n\\) for all positive integers \\(n\\geq 3.\\)\n\n\nSolution. Since \\(4=2^{3-1}=2^2=4>3\\) the statement is true for \\(n=3.\\) Assume that the result is true for a positive integer \\(n,\\) we need to show that \\(2^{(n+1)-1}>n+1\\) holds. Starting from \\(2^{n-1}>n\\) we multiply by 2 to obtain \\(2^n>2n.\\) But \\(2n=n+n>n+1\\) since \\(n\\geq 3.\\) Therefore by mathematical induction, \\(2^{(n+1)-1}>2n>n+1\\) for all positive integers \\(n\\geq 3\\) as desired. \\(\\square\\)\n\nNow let’s turn our attention to another variation of mathematical induction called strong induction.\nThe principle of strong (mathematical) induction is also a method of proof and is frequently useful in the theory of numbers. This principle can also be used to prove statements about arays, sequences, and many other structures. Familiarity with this type of argument is essential to subsequent work.\n\nStrong induction was invented by the mathematician, logician, and philosopher Bertrand Russell.\n\n\nTheorem 1.4 A set of positive integers that contains the integer 1, and that has the property: for every positive integer \\(n,\\) if the set contains \\(1,2,\\ldots,n,\\) then it also contains the integer \\(n+1\\); must be the set of all positive integers.\n\n\nProof. Let \\(P\\) be the set with the stated properties and let \\(S\\) be the set consisting of all positive integers not in \\(P.\\) Assuming that \\(S\\) is nonempty, we can choose \\(n\\) to be the least integer in \\(S\\) by the Well-Ordering Principle. Since \\(1\\) is in \\(P\\) and \\(n\\) is not in \\(P\\), we know that \\(n>1\\). Further, notice that none of the integers \\(1,2,3,\\ldots,n-1\\) lies in \\(S\\), so that in fact, they are in \\(P\\). Then by the second property, \\(n=(n-1)+1\\) is in \\(P,\\) which contradicts \\(n\\) is not in \\(P\\). Thus, \\(S\\) is empty and \\(P\\) must be the set of all positive integers. \\(\\square\\)\n\nWhile the hypothesis is stronger, both statements are actually logically equivalent to each other, as the next theorem states.\n\nTheorem 1.5 (Induction Principles) The following statements are logically equivalent.\n\n(Mathematical Induction) If \\(P\\) is a subset of the natural numbers with the following properties: a) \\(0 \\in P\\), and b) for all \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(k \\in P\\) implies \\(k+1 \\in P\\), then \\(P\\) is the set of natural numbers.\n(Strong Induction) If \\(P\\) is a subset of the natural numbers with the following properties: a) \\(0 \\in P\\), and b) for all \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(0,1,..., k \\in P\\) implies \\(k+1 \\in P\\), then \\(P\\) is the set of natural numbers.\n\n\nWhich one you choose is often a matter of convenience. Some statements are much easier to work with using one or the other. Can you tell which version is used in the next example?\n\nExample 1.13 Let \\(a\\) be a real number. Prove that for all \\(n\\geq 1\\),\n\\[a^n-1=(a-1)\\left(a^{n-1}+a^{n-2}+a^{n-3}+\\text{...}+a+1\\right).\\]\n\n\nSolution. For \\(n=1,\\) \\(a-1=a-1\\) is obvious. Suppose that the equation is true for \\(k\\) namely,\n\\[\\left(a^k-1\\right)=(a-1)\\left(a^{k-1}+a^{k-2}+a^{k-3}+\\cdots+a+1\\right).\\]\nThen for \\(k+1\\) we have\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\left(a^{k+1}-1\\right) & =\\left(a^{k+1}-a^k+a^k-1\\right) \\\\\n& =a^k(a-1)+(a-1)\\left(a^{k-1}+a^{k-2}+a^{k-3}+\\cdots+a+1\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nand so\n\\[\\left(a^{k+1}-1\\right)=(a-1)\\left(a^k+a^{k-1}+a^{k-2}+a^{k-3}+\\cdots+a+1\\right).\\]\nas desired. \\(\\square\\)\n\nWe can also rely on the strong principle of induction, by considering the formula:\n\\[a^{n+1}-1=(a+1)\\left(a^n-1\\right)-a\\left(a^{n-1}-1\\right)\\]\nif desired.\nNow in order to understand the difference between strong induction and mathematical induction, we will consider the Lucas numbers. The following example illustrates when strong induction might be the preferred method.\nTo illustrate the strong form of induction we will discuss the Lucas numbers. Numbers in the sequence \\(1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, \\ldots\\) are called Lucas numbers. They are defined inductively by, \\(L_1=1\\), \\(L_2=3,\\) and\n\\[L_n=L_{n-1}+L_{n-2} \\quad  \\text{for all $n\\geq 3$}. \\]\nThe Lucas numbers have a number of interesting mathematical properties, and they can be used to generate a variety of different patterns and sequences. They also show up in a surprising number of real-world applications, from financial markets to computer algorithms.\n\nExample 1.14 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n\\),\n\\[L_n < \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^n. \\qquad(1.4)\\]\n\n\nSolution. For the basis step notice that\n\\[L_1=1< \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^1=\\frac{7}{4}. \\]\nNow assume (strong induction hypothesis) that (Equation 1.4) holds true for \\(n=1, \\dots, k-1\\). Then we find,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nL_k = L_{k-1}+L_{k-2} & < \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^{k-1}+\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^{k-2}\n\\\\[5pt] & =\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^{k-2} \\left(\\frac{7}{4}+1\\right)\n\\\\[5pt] & =\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^{k-2} \\left(\\frac{11}{4}\\right)\n\\\\[5pt] & < \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^{k-2} \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^{2}\n\\\\[5pt] & = \\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^{k}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nBecause the inequality is true for \\(n=k\\) whenever it is true for the integers \\(1, 2, \\dots, k-1\\), we conclude, by Strong Induction, that \\(L_n < (7/4)^n\\) for all \\(n\\geq 1\\). \\(\\square\\)\n\nWhen first studying mathematical induction a student often runs into solving the postage stamp problem.\n\nExample 1.15 Show that any amount of postage more than 1-cent can be formed just using 2-cent and 3-cent stamps.\n\n\nSolution. Notice that 2-cent and 3-cent stamps can be formed using 2-cent and 3-cent stamps, so the base case is obvious. Let \\(k\\) be a positive integer with \\(k\\geq 1\\). For an induction hypothesis (strong), assume that any amount of postage up to \\(k\\)-cents can be formed using 2-cent and 3-cent stamps. Then using \\(k+1 = k-1+ 2\\), and the fact that \\(2\\) is a 2-cent stamp and \\(k-1\\) can be formed using 2-cent and 3-cent stamps, we see that \\(k+1\\) can be formed using 2-cent and 3-cent stamps. Hence by strong induction, any amount can be formed using 2-cent and 3-cent stamps. \\(\\square\\)\n\nFor our next example, let’s use a new function. Define a function recursively, for all positive integers \\(n\\) by \\(f(1)=1,\\) \\(f(2)=5\\) and\n\\[f(n+1)=f(n)+2f(n-1).\\]\nFor example, \\(f(1)=1\\), \\(f(2)=5\\), \\(f(3)=7\\), \\(f(4)=17\\), and so on. We can (exhaustively) search for patterns until we find this gem:\n\nExample 1.16 Prove that \\(f(n)=2^n+(-1)^n\\) for all positive integers \\(n\\).\n\n\nSolution. For \\(n=1\\) and \\(n=2\\), we have \\(f(1)=1=2^1+(-1)^1\\) and \\(f(2)=5=2^2+(-1)^2\\), so the base case holds. Let \\(k\\) be a positive integer with \\(k\\geq 1\\). Assume \\(f(n)=2^n+(-1)^n\\) holds for \\(n=0,.\\ldots, k\\). Then\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf(k+1) & = f(k)+2f(k-1) \\\\\n& = 2^k+(-1)^k +2 ( 2^{k-1}+(-1)^{k-1}) \\\\\n&  = 2^k +2^k +(-1)^k + 2((-1)^{k-1}) \\\\\n&  = 2^{k+1} + (-1)^{k+1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nTherefore, the result follows by strong induction. \\(\\square\\)\n\nIf you haven’t seen these examples on mathematical induction you should work through them before moving on to the Mathematical Induction Equivalence.\nIn this video, you’ll learn the Mathematical Induction Equivalence, the equivalence of the well-ordering principle, mathematical induction, and strong induction. You’ll see that if the well-ordering principle holds then induction must also hold. Then we’ll prove that if induction holds, then strong induction must also hold. Finally, then we prove that if strong induction holds, then the well-ordering principle must also hold. Proving these three statements is the same as proving all three of them are logically equivalent. Effectively, what this means is that if you assume one of them is true, then all three of them must be true.\nThe Mathematical Induction Equivalence is the statement that all three of these statements:\n\nThe Well-Ordering Principle\nThe Principle of Mathematical Induction\nThe Strong Form of Induction\n\nare all equivalent to each other.\nNow in order to prove the Mathematical Induction Equivalence, let’s review what these three statements are.\n\nTheorem 1.6 (Well-Ordering Principle) Every nonempty set of natural numbers has a least element.\n\n\nTheorem 1.7 (Mathematical Induction) If \\(P\\) is a subset of the natural numbers with the following properties: 1) \\(0 \\in P\\), and 2) for all \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(k \\in P\\) implies \\(k+1 \\in P\\), then \\(P\\) is the set of natural numbers.\n\n\nTheorem 1.8 (Strong Induction) If \\(P\\) is a subset of the natural numbers with the following properties: 1) \\(0 \\in P\\), and 2) for all \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(0,1,..., k \\in P\\) implies \\(k+1 \\in P\\), then \\(P\\) is the set of natural numbers.\n\nLet’s use WOP, PMI, and SFI for the abbreviations for these three statements, respectively.\n\nOur goal is to prove the equivalence of these three statements.\n\nMathematical induction is a technique used to prove that a certain property holds for all natural numbers. The well-ordering principle states that every non-empty set of natural numbers contains a smallest element. We will now prove that the well-ordering principle implies mathematical induction.\n\nTheorem 1.9 \\(WOP\\Rightarrow PMI\\)\n\n\nProof. Let \\(P\\) be a subset of natural numbers with \\(0\\in P\\) and the property, for all natural numbers \\(k\\), \\(k\\in P\\) implies \\(k+1\\in P\\). Assume, for a contradiction, there exists a nonempty set \\(S\\) containing the natural numbers not in \\(P\\). By the Well-Ordering Principle, \\(S\\) has a least natural number, \\(s\\). Since \\(0\\in P\\), \\(s\\neq 0\\). Thus there exists a natural number \\(t\\) such that \\(t+1=s\\). Notice \\(t\\mathbb{N}ot\\in S\\) since \\(t<s\\). Thus \\(t\\in P\\) and so \\(s=t+1\\in P\\). This contradiction shows \\(S\\) cannot exist, meaning \\(P=\\mathbb{N}\\) as desired. \\(\\square\\)\n\nAs a fun exercise for the reader, you should try proving that \\(PMI\\Rightarrow WOP\\). After trying that, read on.\nIn case you’ve heard of terms like weak induction or strong induction, we will now see they are actually equivalent. The advantage of having different mathematical induction variations though is to have flexibility when writing proofs.\n\nTheorem 1.10 \\(PMI\\Rightarrow SFI\\)\n\n\nProof. Let \\(S\\) be a set of natural numbers with \\(0\\in S\\) and the property, for all natural numbers \\(k\\), \\(0,1,2...,k\\in S\\) implies \\(k+1\\in S\\). Let \\(P\\) be the set of natural numbers for which \\(0,2, ..., n\\in S\\) is true. Notice \\(0\\in P\\) since \\(0\\in S\\). Assume \\(k\\in P\\). Then \\(0,1,2, ..., k\\in S\\). Thus \\(0,1,2,3,..., k , k+1\\in S\\) meaning \\(k+1\\in P\\). By I, \\(P=\\mathbb{N}\\). By definition of \\(P\\), \\(S=\\mathbb{N}\\) as desired. \\(\\square\\)\n\nNotice that only \\(PMI\\Rightarrow SFI\\) was proven above. The converse statement, namely \\(SFI\\Rightarrow PMI\\) is left for the reader.\nOne of the most important statements in number theory is the well-ordering principle. This principle states that every non-empty set of natural numbers contains a smallest element. In other words, there is no infinite sequence of natural numbers in which each number is smaller than the one before it. The well-ordering principle is often used to prove results by contradiction. This makes it a very powerful tool for mathematical reasoning. Now it’s time to show that strong induction implies the well-ordering principle.\n\nTheorem 1.11 \\(SFI\\Rightarrow WOP\\)\n\n\nProof. Assume, for a contradiction, there exists a nonempty set of natural numbers \\(S\\) with no least element. Let \\(P\\) be the set of natural numbers for which \\(n\\mathbb{N}otin S\\) is true. Because \\(0\\) is the least element of all natural numbers, \\(0\\mathbb{N}otin S\\) and so \\(0\\in P\\). Assume \\(0,1,...,k\\in P\\). If \\(k+1\\in S\\) then \\(k+1\\) is the least element of \\(S\\). However, \\(S\\) has no least element and thus \\(k+1\\mathbb{N}otin S\\). Thus, \\(k+1\\in P\\) and so by Strong Induction, \\(P=\\mathbb{N}\\). This contradiction shows \\(S\\) can not exist. Therefore, \\(S=\\mathbb{N}\\). \\(\\square\\)\n\nNotice that only \\(SFI\\Rightarrow WOP\\) was proven above. The converse statement, namely \\(WOP\\Rightarrow SFI\\) is left for the reader.\nOkay, so we have proven that \\(WOP\\Rightarrow PMI \\Rightarrow SFI \\Rightarrow WOP\\). This means, logically speaking that, \\(WOP\\Leftrightarrow PMI \\Leftrightarrow SFI\\), and so all three theorems above are proven.\nAs discussed above, there are several variations of mathematical induction. Now we would like to show that these are equivalent also. Recall we use the notation \\[N_a = \\{k\\in \\mathbb{N}: k\\geq a\\}\\] where \\(a\\) is a natural number.\n\nTheorem 1.12 (Mathematical Induction Equivalence**)) Let \\(a\\) be a fixed natural number. The following statements are logically equivalent.\n\nEvery nonempty set of \\(\\mathbb{N}_a\\) has a least element.\nIf \\(a\\in P\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}_a\\) and for all \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}_a\\), \\(k \\in P\\) implies \\(k+1 \\in P\\), then \\(P=\\mathbb{N}_a\\).\nIf \\(a\\in P\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}_a\\) and for all \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}_a\\), \\(a,a+1,\\ldots,a+k \\in P\\) implies \\(a+k+1 \\in P\\), then \\(P=\\mathbb{N}_a\\).\n\n\n\nProof. \\((1)\\Rightarrow (2)\\): Let \\(P\\subseteq \\mathbb{N}_a\\) with \\(a\\in P\\) and the property, for all natural numbers \\(k\\), \\(k\\in P\\) implies \\(k+1\\in P\\). Assume, for a contradiction, there exists a nonempty subset \\(S\\) of \\(\\mathbb{N}_a\\) containing the natural numbers not in \\(P\\). By the Well-Ordering Principle, \\(S\\) has a least natural number, \\(s\\). Since \\(a\\in P\\), \\(s\\neq a\\). Further, since \\(s\\in S\\subseteq \\mathbb{N}_a\\) we know that \\(s>a\\). Thus there exists a natural number \\(t\\) such that \\(t+1=a\\). Notice \\(t\\mathbb{N}ot\\in S\\) since \\(t<s\\). Thus \\(t\\in P\\) and so \\(s=t+1\\in P\\). This contradiction shows \\(S\\) cannot exist, meaning \\(P=\\mathbb{N}_a\\) as desired.\n\\((2)\\Rightarrow (3)\\): Let \\(S\\) be a set of natural numbers with \\(a\\in S\\) and the property, for all natural numbers \\(k\\), \\(a,a+1,\\ldots,a+k\\in S\\) implies \\(a+k+1\\in S\\). Let \\(P\\) be the set of natural numbers for which \\(a,a+1, \\ldots, a+n\\in S\\) is true. Notice \\(a\\in P\\) since \\(a\\in S\\). Assume \\(k\\in P\\). Then \\(a,a+1, \\ldots, a+k\\in S\\). Thus \\(a,a+1,\\ldots, a+k, a+k+1\\in S\\) meaning \\(a+k+1\\in P\\). Hence, \\(P=\\mathbb{N}_a\\). By definition of \\(P\\), \\(S=\\mathbb{N}_a\\) as desired.\n\\((3)\\Rightarrow (1)\\): Assume, for a contradiction, there exists a nonempty subset \\(S\\) of \\(\\mathbb{N}_a\\) with no least element. Let \\(P\\) be the set of natural numbers for which \\(n\\mathbb{N}otin S\\) is true. Because \\(a\\) is the least element of all elements in \\(\\mathbb{N}_a\\), \\(a\\mathbb{N}otin S\\) and so \\(a\\in P\\). Assume \\(a,a+1,\\ldots,a+k\\in P\\). If \\(a+k+1\\in S\\) then \\(a+k+1\\) is the least element of \\(S\\). However, \\(S\\) has no least element and thus \\(a+k+1\\mathbb{N}otin S\\). Thus, \\(a+k+1\\in P\\) and so \\(P=\\mathbb{N}_a\\). This contradiction shows \\(S\\) can not exist. \\(\\square\\)\n\nThere are many other forms of mathematical induction. We are only limited by our imagination. But for now, let’s work through more exercises on mathematical induction.\nMathematical induction is one of the most powerful techniques in mathematics. It allows us to prove a statement for a certain set of numbers, and then use that proof to show that the statement is true for all natural numbers. In this section, we will give some exercises on mathematical induction to help you understand the technique better. We will also provide solutions to these exercises so that you can check your work. Let’s get started!\n\nExample 1.17 Prove that\n\\[\\sum _{k=1}^n k^3=\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2\\]\nfor all positive integers \\(n.\\)\n\n\nSolution. For \\(n=1,\\)\n\\[ 1=\\sum _{k=1}^1 k^3=\\left(\\frac{1(1+1)}{2}\\right)^2=1. \\]\nAssume that the result is true for a positive integer \\(n,\\) we need to show that\n\\[ \\sum _{k=1}^{n+1} k^3=\\left(\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\right)^2 \\]\nholds. We have\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\sum _{k=1}^{n+1} k^3\n& =(n+1)^3+\\sum _{k=1}^n k^3 \\\\\n& =(n+1)^3+\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2 \\\\\n& =\\left(\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\right)^2.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTherefore by mathematical induction\n\\[\\sum _{k=1}^{n+1} k^3=\\left(\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\right)^2\\]\nholds true for all positive integers \\(n.\\) \\(\\square\\)\n\n\nExample 1.18 Prove that \\(2\\cdot 6 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 14 \\cdots (4n-2) = \\frac{(2n)!}{n!}\\) for all positive integers \\(n.\\)\n\n\nSolution. For \\(n=1\\) we have \\(2 = \\frac{2!}{1!} = \\frac{2}{1}\\) so the base case holds. Assume that\n\\[2\\cdot 6 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 14 \\cdots (4k-2) = \\frac{(2k)!}{k!}\\]\nfor some positive integer \\(k\\). Then\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& 2\\cdot 6 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 14 \\cdots (4k-2) \\cdot (4k+2)  \\\\[8pt]\n& \\qquad = \\frac{(2k)!}{k!} \\cdot (4k+2)  \\\\[8pt]\n& \\qquad = \\frac{(2k)!

The result follows by mathematical induction. \\(\\square\\)"

    "text": "1.6 The Fibonacci Sequence\nFibonacci numbers have been found to occur in many areas of mathematics, as well as in nature. For example, the proportions of many spiral shells can be expressed as Fibonacci numbers.\n\nFibonacci numbers were highlighted by the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci), who was investigating the growth of rabbit populations. He realized that the Fibonacci sequence could be used to model the way in which rabbits reproduce.\n\nFibonacci numbers also appear in the DNA molecule and in the arrangement of leaves on a stem. It seems that Fibonacci numbers are ubiquitous in both mathematics and nature!\nThe Fibonacci numbers start with 0 and 1, and then the next Fibonacci number is 1 \\((0+1),\\) and the next Fibonacci number is 2 \\((1+1),\\) and so on. As a result, the Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987,…\nFibonacci numbers play an important role in mathematics and have a wide range of applications. They are also closely related to the golden ratio, which is often found in nature. Fibonacci numbers can be generated by starting with 0 and 1, and then adding the two previous numbers to get the next number in the sequence. This relationship is known as the Fibonacci recurrence.\nThe Fibonacci numbers are also related to each other by a plethora of (Fibonacci identities) identities. These identities can be proved using mathematical induction. How? First, the base case must be proven true for \\(n=0.\\) Then, the inductive step, it must be shown that if the Fibonacci identities are true for \\(n=k\\), then they are also true for \\(n=k+1.\\) By following this process, it can be shown that a Fibonacci identity holds. As a result, these identities provide a powerful tool for understanding and manipulating Fibonacci numbers.\nAfter having studied mathematical induction the Fibonacci numbers are a good topic to test ones abilities to perform induction. There are two obvious reasons for this. Firstly, many of the results (exercises) for are relatively straight-forward. Secondly, many of the results obtain are quite surprising. For instance, the sum of the squares of the first \\(n\\) Fibonacci numbers is the same as the product of the \\(n\\)-th and the \\(n+1\\)-th. This fact is easily provable by mathematical induction. We now study the Fibonacci Numbers and the Euler-Binet Formula.\nFibonacci numbers are defined as a recursive sequence by starting with \\(0\\) and \\(1,\\) and then adding the previous two integers together. It has long been noticed that the Fibonacci numbers arise in many places throughout the natural world. Fibonacci numbers have many special mathematical properties.\n\nDefinition 1.6 Fibonacci numbers are the positive integers defined by \\(f_0=0,\\) \\(f_1=1,\\) and\n\\[f_{n}=f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}\\]\nfor \\(n\\geq 2.\\)\n\nThe first 21 Fibonacci numbers are\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\n1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 13 \\\\\n21 & 34 & 55 & 89 & 144 & 233 & 377 \\\\\n610 & 987 & 1597 & 2584 & 4181 & 6765 & 10946\n\\end{array}\\]\nHere we prove several identities involving Fibonacci numbers. The idea is to provide several interesting examples on how mathematical induction can be applied to give rigorous arguments on (perhaps) experimentally found identities.\n\nExample 1.19 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n\\),\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^n f_{i}^2  = f_n f_{n+1}. \\qquad(1.5)\\]\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(P\\) be the set of positive integers for which (Equation 1.5) is true. Since \\(f_0^2 =0=f_0 f_1\\) we see \\(0\\in P\\). Assume \\(k\\in P\\). It follows \\(k+1\\in P\\) by\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=0}^{k+1} f_i^2\n& =\\sum_{i=0}^{k} f_i^2+ f_{k+1}^2 \\\\[8pt]\n& =f_k f_{k+1}+f_{k+1}^2  \\\\[8pt]\n& =f_{k+1}(f_k+f_{k+1}) \\\\[8pt]\n& =f_{k+1} f_{k+2}.\n\\end{align}\\]\nBy mathematical induction \\(P=\\mathbb{N}\\) as desired. \\(\\square\\)\n\n\nExample 1.20 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n,\\)\n\\[\\sum_{j=1}^n f_{2j}=f_{2n+1}-1. \\qquad(1.6)\\]\n\n\nSolution. For \\(n=1,\\) \\(f_2=1= f_3-1\\) so the base case holds. Assume, for some positive integer \\(k,\\) that (Equation 1.6) holds. Then we find\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{j=1}^{k+1} f_{2j}\n& = \\sum_{j=1}^k f_{2j}+f_{2k+2} \\\\[8pt]\n& = f_{2k+1}-1+f_{2k+2} \\\\[8pt]\n& = f_{2k+3}-1.\n\\end{align}\\]\nBy mathematical induction, (Equation 1.6) holds for all positive integers \\(n.\\) \\(\\square\\)\n\n\nExample 1.21 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n\\),\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n f_{2i-1} = f_{2n}. \\qquad(1.7)\\]\n\n\nSolution. Since \\(f_1=1=f_2\\) we see the base case holds. Assume, for some positive integer \\(k\\), that (Equation 1.7) holds.

For \\(n=1,\\) \\(f_2f_0-\\left(f_1\\right)^2=(-1)^1\\) so the base case holds. Assume, for some positive integer \\(k\\), that (Equation 1.9) holds. Then we find\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf_{k+2}f_k-\\left(f_{k+1}\\right){}^2\n& =\\left(f_{k+1}+f_k\\right)f_k-\\left(f_{k+1}\\right)\\left(f_{k-1}+f_k\\right) \\\\[8pt]\n& =f_{k+1}f_k+\\left(f_k\\right){}^2-f_{k+1}f_{k-1}-f_{k+1}f_k \\\\[8pt]\n& =(-1)\\left(-\\left(f_k\\right){}^2+f_{k+1}f_{k-1}\\right)  \\\\[8pt]\n& =(-1)(-1)^k  \\\\[8pt]\n& =(-1)^{k+1}.\n\\end{align}\\]\nBy mathematical induction, (Equation 1.9) holds for all positive integers \\(n.\\) \\(\\square\\)\n\nFrom our previous video, we recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nDefinition 1.7 Fibonacci numbers are the positive integers defined by \\(f_0=0,\\) \\(f_1=1,\\) and\n\\[f_{n}=f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}\\]\nfor \\(n\\geq 2.\\)\n\nThe first 21 Fibonacci numbers are\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\n1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 13 \\\\\n21 & 34 & 55 & 89 & 144 & 233 & 377 \\\\\n610 & 987 & 1597 & 2584 & 4181 & 6765 & 10946\n\\end{array}\\]\nIn our previous lecture we also proved the following 5 Fibonacci identities.\n\nExample 1.24 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n\\),\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^n f_{i}^2  = f_n f_{n+1}.\\]\n\n\nExample 1.25 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n\\),\n\\[\\sum_{j=1}^n f_{2j}=f_{2n+1}-1.\\]\n\n\nExample 1.26 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n\\),\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n f_{2i-1} = f_{2n}.\\]\n\n\nExample 1.27 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n,\\)\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i = f_{n+2}-1.\\]\n\n\nExample 1.28 Prove that for all positive integers \\(n,\\)\n\\[f_{n+1}f_{n-1}-\\left(f_n\\right){}^2=(-1)^n.\\]\n\nNow let’s see what this infamous formula is all about.\nThe Fibonacci numbers also have an interesting relationship to the golden ratio. This relationship is expressed by a formula called the Euler-Binet formula. And this simple equation has surprising implications, and it has been used to derive many other results in mathematics. The Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio continue to fascinate mathematicians and laypeople alike, and they are sure to continue to yield new insights in the future.\nFirstly, we notice that the Euler-Binet formula gives us a closed form for calculating the \\(n\\)-th Fibonacci number. In fact, the formula is in terms of the golden ratio \\(\\phi.\\) To prove the formula we first need the following lemma involving the golden ratio.\n\nLemma 1.17 For any solution \\(x\\) of \\(x^2-x-1=0\\) and any positive integer \\(n\\), \\[x^n=x f_n+f_{n-1}.\\]\n\n\nProof. Proof by mathematical induction. Clearly, \\(x^1= x f_1+f_{0}=x (1)+0=x\\) so the base case holds. Assume now that, for some positive integer \\(k\\), that\n\\[ x^k=x f_k+f_{k-1}. \\]\nWe wish to prove that\n\\[x^{k+1}=x f_{k+1}+f_{k}.\\]\nTo this end, multiply the identity by \\(x\\) to obtain\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx^{k+1}\n& =x^2 f_k+ x f_{k-1} \\\\[8pt]\n& = (x+1) f_k+x f_{k-1} \\\\[8pt]\n& = x(f_k+f_{k-1})+f_k  \\\\[8pt]\n& = x f_{k+1}+f_k\n\\end{align}\\]\nas needed.\n\nThe golden ratio is the positive root of the quadratic equation \\(x^2-x-1=0,\\) that is,\n\\[\\phi=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\\]\nThe conjugate of \\(\\phi\\) is denoted using \\(\\tau\\) and is\n\\[\\tau=\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\\]\nIt is easily verified that \\(\\phi\\tau=-1\\) and \\(\\phi-\\tau=\\sqrt{5}\\).

Now observe that (Theorem 1.13) follows since \\(\\phi-\\tau=\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nThe first 75 Fibonacci numbers.\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, 1346269, 2178309, 3524578, 5702887, 9227465, 14930352, 24157817, 39088169, 63245986, 102334155, 165580141, 267914296, 433494437, 701408733, 1134903170, 1836311903, 2971215073, 4807526976, 7778742049, 12586269025, 20365011074, 32951280099, 53316291173, 86267571272, 139583862445, 225851433717, 365435296162, 591286729879, 956722026041, 1548008755920, 2504730781961, 4052739537881, 6557470319842, 10610209857723, 17167680177565, 27777890035288, 44945570212853, 72723460248141, 117669030460994, 190392490709135, 308061521170129, 498454011879264, 806515533049393, 1304969544928657, 2111485077978050\n\nThe next example shows that the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially fast.\n\nExample 1.29 Prove that \\(f_n>\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{n-1}\\), for all \\(n\\geq 6\\).\n\n\nSolution.

    "text": "1.7 Universal Property of Natural Numbers\n\nTheorem 1.14 (Universal Property of Natural Numbers) Let \\(S\\) be any set, \\(f:S\\to S\\) be any function, and let \\(x_0\\in S\\). Then there exists a unique function \\(\\phi:\\mathbb{N}\\to S\\) such that \\(\\phi(1)=x_0\\) and \\(\\phi\\circ s=f\\circ \\phi\\).\n\n\nProof. We will rely upon the set-theoretic principle that a subset \\(\\Gamma\\subseteq A\\times B\\) is the graph of a function from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) if and only if \\(p:\\Gamma\\to A\\) is a bijection. We wish to construct a mapping \\(\\phi:\\mathbb{N}\\to S\\) and so \\(p:\\Gamma \\to \\mathbb{N}\\) must be a bijection with graph \\(\\Gamma\\subseteq \\mathbb{N}\\times S\\). We also insist that \\(\\phi(1)=x_0\\) which means \\((1,x_0)\\in \\Gamma\\). Since \\(\\Gamma\\) is expected to be the graph of the yet unconstructed function \\(\\phi\\), for any \\(n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), we must have elements of the form \\((n, \\phi(n)) \\in \\Gamma\\). So, if \\((n, t) \\in \\Gamma\\), then \\(t\\) is expected to be \\(\\phi(n)\\). Then, the second condition says that \\(\\phi(s(n)) = f(\\phi(n))\\) and hence \\((s(n),f(t)) \\in \\Gamma\\). This says, if we prescribe \\(\\theta : \\mathbb{N}\\times S \\to \\mathbb{N}\\times S\\) as \\(\\theta(n,t) = (s(n),f(t))\\), then \\(\\theta(\\Gamma) \\subseteq \\Gamma\\). So let \\(\\theta\\) be so prescribed, we see that these three conditions ensure what we need:\n\n\\(p:\\Gamma\\to A\\) is a bijection \n\\((1,x_0)\\in \\Gamma\\) \n\\(\\theta(\\Gamma) \\subseteq \\Gamma\\).\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) be the set of all subsets of \\(\\mathbb{N} \\times S\\) satisfying \\((ii)\\) and \\((iii)\\). Notice that \\((1,x_0)\\in \\mathbb{N}\\times S\\), and so \\(\\mathbb{N}\\times S\\) satisfies \\((ii)\\). If \\((s(n),f(t))\\in \\theta(\\mathbb{N}\\times S)\\), then by the definitions of \\(s\\) and \\(f\\) we see that \\((s(n),f(t))\\in \\mathbb{N}\\times S\\), and so \\(\\mathbb{N}\\times S\\) satisfies \\((iii)\\). Then \\(\\mathbb{N} \\times S \\in \\mathcal{C}\\), and hence this collection is nonempty.\n\\(b)\\) and \\(c)\\): Let \\(\\Gamma\\) be the intersection of all elements in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). First let us check that \\(\\Gamma\\in\\mathcal{C}\\). This is easy, since \\((1, x_0) \\in X\\) for all \\(X \\in \\mathcal{C}\\) and \\(\\Gamma\\) being the intersection of such sets, \\((1,x_0) \\in\\Gamma\\). Similarly, for any \\(X \\in\\mathcal{C}\\), \\(\\theta(\\Gamma) \\subseteq \\theta(X) \\subseteq X\\) and thus \\(\\theta(\\Gamma) \\subseteq X\\) for all \\(X \\in \\mathcal{C}\\). So, by definition of \\(\\Gamma\\), \\(\\theta(\\Gamma) \\subseteq \\Gamma\\). So, \\(\\Gamma\\) satisfies \\(b)\\) and \\(c)\\), and hence \\(\\Gamma \\in \\mathcal{C}\\).\n\\(a)\\): First, consider the set \\(G = \\theta(\\Gamma) \\cup \\{(1, x_0)\\}\\). Then clearly \\(G \\subseteq \\Gamma\\). On the other hand, \\((1,x_0) \\in G\\) and \\[\n\\theta(G) \\subseteq  \\theta(\\theta(\\Gamma))\\cup \\theta(\\{(1,x_0)\\} \\subseteq  \\theta(\\Gamma) \\subseteq  G.\n\\] So, \\(G \\in \\mathcal{C}\\) and thus by definition of \\(\\Gamma\\), we get \\(\\Gamma \\subseteq G\\). This shows that \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{gisgam}\n\\theta(\\Gamma) \\cup  \\{(1, x_0)\\} = G = \\Gamma.\n\\end{equation}\\] We prove that \\(p : \\Gamma \\to\\mathbb{N}\\) is a bijection by applying induction to the set, \\[\nT = \\{n \\in  \\mathbb{N} \\mid p^{-1}(n) \\subseteq  \\Gamma \\text{ has exactly one element}\\}.\n\\] Notice that if \\(T = \\mathbb{N}\\), then \\(p\\) is a bijection.\nWe have \\(p(1,x_0) = 1\\) and we wish to show that \\(p^{-1}(1) = \\{(1,x_0)\\}\\). If not, say \\((1,t) \\in p^{-1}(1)\\) with \\(t\\neq x_0\\). By \\(\\eqref{gisgam}\\), we see that \\((1, t) \\in \\theta(\\Gamma)\\). So, there exists an element \\((n, u) \\in \\Gamma\\) such that \\((1, t) = \\theta(n, u) = (s(n), f (u))\\). This says in particular, \\(1 = s(n)\\) contradicting Peano’s axiom. This proves that \\(p^{-1}(1) = \\{(1,x_0)\\}\\) and hence \\(1 \\in T\\).\nNext, assume that \\(n \\in T\\). Then by definition, we have \\(p^{-1}(n) = \\{(n, w)\\}\\). Since \\((n, w) \\in \\Gamma\\), we know that \\(\\theta(n, w) = (s(n), f(w)) \\in \\Gamma\\), since \\(\\theta(\\Gamma) \\subseteq \\Gamma\\). Thus \\(p^{-1}(s(n))\\) contains \\((s(n),f(w))\\). If we can show this is the only element in this set, we would have shown \\(s(n) \\in T\\) and then by induction, we would be done. So, assume that \\((s(n),x) \\in \\Gamma\\) and we want to show that \\(x = f(w)\\). By Peano’s axiom, \\((s(n),x)\\neq (1,x_0)\\) and hence, from \\(\\eqref{gisgam}\\), we see that \\((s(n),x) \\in \\theta(\\Gamma)\\) and thus there is an element \\((m, y) \\in \\Gamma\\) with \\(\\theta(m, y) = (s(n), x)\\). Then \\(s(m) = s(n)\\) and \\(f(y) = x\\). By injectivity of \\(s\\), we get \\(m = n\\). Since \\((m,y)=(n,y)\\in \\Gamma\\) and \\(n \\in T\\) implies \\(y=w\\). Then \\(x=f(w)\\) and thus \\((s(n), x) = (s(n), f(w))\\) proving what we set out to prove. Thus \\(T = \\mathbb{N}\\) and hence \\(p\\) is a bijection."

    "section": "2.2 Divisibility and The Division Algorithm",
    "text": "2.2 Divisibility and The Division Algorithm\nWe begin by stating the definition of divisibility, the main topic of discussion. We then give a few examples followed by several basic lemmas on divisibility. The Well-Ordering Axiom, which is used in the proof of the Division Algorithm, is then stated. Examples demonstrating how to use the Division Algorithm as a method of proof are then given.\nCertainly the sum, difference and product of any two integers is an integer. The same can not be said about the ratio of two integers. For example, while 2 and 3 are integers, the ratio \\(2/3\\) is not an integer. We simply can not take any to integers and divide them. The study of the integers is to a great extent the study of divisibility.\n\nDefinition 2.1 If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers with \\(a\\neq 0,\\) we say that \\(a\\) divides \\(b,\\) written \\(a | b,\\) if there exists an integer \\(c\\) such that \\(b=a c\\).\n\nHere are some examples of divisibility:\n\n\\(3|6\\) since \\(6=2(3)\\) and \\(2\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\\(6|24\\) since \\(24=4(6)\\) and \\(4\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\\(8|0\\) since \\(0=0(8)\\) and \\(0\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\\(-5|-55\\) since \\(-55=11(-5)\\) and \\(11\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\\(-9|909\\) since \\(909=-101(-9)\\) and \\(-101\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\nThere are other common ways of saying \\(a\\) divides \\(b\\). Namely, \\(a|b\\) is equivalent to all of the following:\n\n\\(a\\) is a divisor of \\(b\\)\n\\(a\\) divides \\(b\\)\n\\(b\\) is divisible by \\(a\\)\n\\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\)\n\\(a\\) is a factor of \\(b\\)\n\nAny integer \\(n\\), except \\(0\\), has just a finite number of divisors. For if \\(a|n\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are positive integers, then \\(n=ak\\) for some integer \\(k\\). Since \\(k\\) is a positive integer, we see that \\(n=ak\\geq a\\). Hence any nonzero integer \\(n\\) can have a most \\(2|n|\\) divisors.\nWe now state and prove the transitive and linear combination properties of divisibility.\n\nLemma 2.1 (Transitive Property of Divisibility]) Let \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) be integers. If \\(a | b\\) and \\(b | c\\), then \\(a | c\\).\n\n\nProof. Suppose \\(a|b\\) and \\(b|c,\\) then there exists integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\(b=m a\\) and \\(c=n b.\\) Thus \\[\nc=n b=n(m a)=(n m )a.\n\\] Since \\(nm\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) we see that \\(a|c\\) as desired.\n\nWe say an integer \\(n\\) is a linear combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) if there exists integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(n=ax+by\\). For example, \\(7\\) is a linear combination of \\(3\\) and \\(2\\) since \\(7=2(2)+1(3)\\). The next lemma says that if an integer divides to other integers, then it divides any linear combination of these two integers.\n\nLemma 2.2 (Linear Combinations) Let \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) be integers. If \\(c|a\\) and \\(c|b,\\) then \\(c|(x a+y b)\\) for any positive integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n\nProof. Suppose \\(c|a\\) and \\(c|b\\). Then there exists integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\(a=m c\\) and \\(b=n c.\\) Assume \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are arbitrary integers. We have \\[\nx a+y b=x(m c)+y(n c)= c(x m+ y n)\n\\] Since \\(x m+ y n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) we see that \\(c|(x a+y b)\\) as desired.\n\nWe now state and prove the antisymmetric and multiplicative properties of divisibility.\n\nLemma 2.3 (Antisymmetric Property of Divisibility) Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be nonzero positive integers. If \\(a | b\\) and \\(b |a\\), then \\(a= b.\\)\n\n\nProof. Suppose \\(a|b\\) and \\(b|a,\\) then there exists integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\(b=m a\\) and \\(a=n b.\\) Notice that both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive since both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are.\nThen we have \\[\na=n b= n(m a) = (n m) a.\n\\] Thus, \\(n m=1\\) and so in particular \\(n= 1.\\) Whence, \\(a= b\\) as desired.\n\n\nLemma 2.4 (Multiplicative Property of Divisibility) Let \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) be integers. If \\(c\\neq 0\\) and \\(a|b\\) then \\(a c|b c.\\)\n\n\nProof. Suppose \\(a|b\\). Then there exists an integer \\(n\\) such that \\(b=n a.\\) By substitution we find, \\[\nb c=(n c) a=(a c) n.\n\\] Since \\(c\\neq 0\\), it follows that \\(ac\\neq 0\\), and so \\(a c| b c\\) as needed.\n\n\nLemma 2.5 Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be integers. If \\(a|b,\\) then \\(a^n|b^n\\) for any natural number \\(n.\\)\n\n\nProof. We will use mathematical induction. Since \\(a|b\\) certainly implies \\(a|b,\\) the case for \\(k=1\\) is trivial. Assume that \\(a^k|b^k\\) holds for some natural number \\(k>1\\). Then there exists an integer \\(m\\) such that \\(b^k=m a^k.\\) Then \\[\nb^{k+1}=b b^k\n=b \\left(m a^k\\right)\n=(b m )a^k\n=(m' a m )a^k\n=M a^{k+1}\n\\] where \\(m'\\) and \\(M\\) are integers. Whence, \\(a^{k+1}|b^{k+1}\\) as desired.\n\nBefore we state and prove the Division Algorithm, let’s recall the Well-Ordering Axiom, namely:\n\nEvery nonempty set of positive integers contains a least element.\n\nThis is an incredible important and powerful statement. We will use the Well-Ordering Axiom to prove the Division Algorithm .\nThe proof of the Division Algorithm illustrates the technique of proving existence and uniqueness and relies upon the Well-Ordering axiom.\n\nTheorem 2.1 (Division Algorithm) If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are nonzero positive integers, then there are unique positive integers \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) such that \\[\na=b q+r \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad 0\\leq r<b.\n\\]\n\n\nProof. First we prove existence. Let \\(b\\) be an arbitrary natural number greater than \\(0\\) and let \\(S\\) be the set of multiples of \\(b\\) that are greater than \\(a\\), namely,\n\\[S=\\{b i \\mid i\\in \\mathbb{N} \\text{ and } b i > a \\}.\\]\nNotice \\(S\\) is nonempty since \\(ab>a\\). By the Well-Ordering Axiom, \\(S\\) must contain a least element, say \\(bk\\). Since \\(k\\not= 0\\), there exists a natural number \\(q\\) such that \\(k=q+1\\). Notice \\(b q\\leq a\\) since \\(bk\\) is the least multiple of \\(b\\) greater than \\(a\\). Thus there exists a natural number \\(r\\) such that \\(a=bq+r\\). Notice \\(0\\leq r\\). Assume, \\(r\\geq b\\). Then there exists a natural number \\(m\\geq 0\\) such that \\(b+m=r\\). By substitution, \\(a=b(q+1)+m\\) and so \\(bk=b(q+1)\\leq a\\). This contradiction shows \\(r<b\\) as needed.\nNow we prove uniqueness. Suppose \\[\na=bq_1 +r_1, \\quad\na=b q_2+r_2, \\quad\n0\\leq r_1<b, \\quad\n0\\leq r_2<b.\n\\] If \\(q_1=q_2\\) then \\(r_1=r_2\\). Assume \\(q_1<q_2\\). Then \\(q_2=q_1+n\\) for some natural number \\(n>0\\). This implies \\[\nr_1=a-b q_1=bq_2+r_2-b q_1=b n +r_2\\geq b n\\geq b\n\\] which is contrary to \\(r_1<b\\). Thus \\(q_1<q_2\\) cannot happen. Similarly, \\(q_2<q_1\\) cannot happen either, and thus \\(q_1=q_2\\) as desired.\n\nWe say an integer \\(a\\) is of the form \\(bq+r\\) if there exists integers \\(b,\\) \\(q,\\) and \\(r\\) such that \\(a=bq+r.\\) Notice that the division algorithm, in a certain sense, measures the divisibility of \\(a\\) by \\(b\\) using a remainder \\(r\\).\n\nExample 2.1 Show \\(3\\) divides \\(a(a^2+2)\\) for any natural number \\(a\\).\n\n\nSolution. Equivalently, we need to show that \\(a\\left(a^2+2\\right)\\) is of the form \\(3k\\) for some \\(k\\) for any natural number \\(a.\\) By the division algorithm, \\(a\\) has exactly one of the forms \\(3 k,\\) \\(3k+1,\\) or \\(3k+2.\\) If \\(a=3k+1\\) for some \\(k,\\) then\n\\[(3k+1)\\left((3k+1)^2+2\\right)=3(3k+1)\\left(3k^2+2k+1\\right)\\] which shows \\(3|a(a^2+2)\\). If \\(a=3k+2\\) for some \\(k,\\) then\n\\[(3k+2)\\left((3k+2)^2+2\\right)=3(3k+2)\\left(3k^2+4k+2\\right)\\] which shows \\(3|a(a^2+2)\\). Finally, if \\(a\\) is of the form \\(3k\\) then we have\n\\[a\\left(a^2+2\\right)=3k\\left(9k^2+2\\right)\\] which shows \\(3|a(a^2+2)\\). Therefore, in all possible cases, \\(3|a(a^2+2))\\) for any positive natural number \\(a\\).\n\nThe advantage of the Division Algorithm is that it allows us to prove statements about the positive integers (integers) by considering only a finite number of cases. The next three examples illustrates this.\n\nExample 2.2 Show \\(6\\) divides the product of any three consecutive positive integers.\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(m\\) be an natural number. We need to show that \\(m(m+1)(m+2)\\) is of the form \\(6 k\\). The division algorithm yields that \\(m\\) is either even or odd (not both). In either case, \\(m(m+1)(m+2)\\) must be even. The natural number \\(m(m+1)(m+2)\\) is also divisible by 3, since one of \\(m,\\) \\(m+1,\\) or \\(m+2\\) is of the form \\(3k\\). Since \\(m(m+1)(m+2)\\) is even and is divisible by 3, it must be divisible by 6.\n\n\nExample 2.3 Prove that, for each natural number \\(n\\), \\(7^n-2^n\\) is divisible by \\(5\\).\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(P\\) be the set of natural number for which \\(7^n-2^n\\) is divisible by \\(5\\). Clearly, \\(7^1-2^1=5\\) is divisible by \\(5\\), so \\(P\\) is nonempty with \\(0\\in P\\). Assume \\(k\\in P\\). We find \\[\\begin{align*}\n7^{k+1}-2^{k+1}\n& = 7\\cdot 7^k-2\\cdot 2^k \\\\\n& = 7\\cdot 7^k-7\\cdot 2^k+7\\cdot 2^k-2\\cdot 2^k  \\\\\n& = 7(7^k- 2^k)+2^k(7 -2)\n\\end{align*}\\] The induction hypothesis is that \\((7^k- 2^k)\\) is divisible by 5. Now since both \\((7^k-\\cdot 2^k)\\) and \\(7-2\\) are divisible by 5, so is any linear combination of \\((7^k- 2^k)\\) and \\(7-2\\). Hence, \\(7^{k+1}-2^{k+1}\\) is divisible by 5 by \\(\\ref{lincombdiv}\\). Therefore, \\(k+1\\in P\\) and so \\(P=\\mathbb{N}\\) by mathematical induction."

    "text": "2.3 Prime Numbers\nSeveral of the most basic and interesting questions concerning the integers involves the prime numbers. For example,\nThis question is easy to understand, but no one has been able to answer it.\nFrom a certain point of very, the prime numbers are the building blocks for the integers; that is to say, every integer greater than 1 has a prime factor. Indeed, every positive integer is a product of primes. This result was known to the ancient Greeks and is sometimes referred to as Euclid{’}s lemma.\nOne of the first questions that comes to mind is concerning prime numbers is: how many prime numbers are there?\" or maybe evenwhy are primes so important to talk about?“.\nWhat about these questions: without using trial division, how can one determine whether a given integer is prime or composite?\",is it possible for given a function to find all the prime numbers?”, ``are there arbitrarily long sequences of integers, all of which are not primes?“. These simple questions have kept mathematicians busy for thousands of years.\n\nDefinition 2.2 A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is divisible by no natural numbers other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number .\n\nThe idea, passing over 1, is to find a prime number and then cross out all of the multiples of this prime number. For example, 2 is prime but every even number is not and so cross all even numbers off the list. Next, 3 is prime and so cross out every multiple of three, because they are not prime. Continue in this fashion, and then the numbers left are the prime numbers. Of course for a given large integer this is not practical, if your time is limited. Since the time of Eratosthenes, sophisticated versions of this algorithm (called the Sieve of Eratosthenes ) have achieved new results.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{llllllllll}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10\n\\\\\n11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20\n\\\\\n21 & 22 & 23 & 24 & 25 & 26 & 27 & 28 & 29 & 30\n\\\\\n31 & 32 & 33 & 34 & 35 & 36 & 37 & 38 & 39 & 40\n\\\\\n41 & 42 & 43 & 44 & 45 & 46 & 47 & 48 & 49 & 50\n\\\\\n51 & 52 & 53 & 54 & 55 & 56 & 57 & 58 & 59 & 60\n\\\\\n61 & 62 & 63 & 64 & 65 & 66 & 67 & 68 & 69 & 70\n\\\\\n71 & 72 & 73 & 74 & 75 & 76 & 77 & 78 & 79 & 80\n\\\\\n81 & 82 & 83 & 84 & 85 & 86 & 87 & 88 & 89 & 90\n\\\\\n91 & 92 & 93 & 94 & 95 & 96 & 97 & 98 & 99 & 100\n\\end{array}\n\\] Consider the first 5 rows in the above array. How many primes are there in the first 5 rows? How many in the last five rows? If one carries out the sieve of Eratosthenes between 10,000 and 10,050, you will find that there are just 4 prime numbers. Can we find 5 rows where there are no prime numbers? What is the last prime number?\nThe following lemma, while known to Euclid, is proven using the (modern) Well-Ordering Axiom.\n\nLemma 2.6 (Prime Divisor) Every natural number greater than 1 has a prime divisor.\n\n\nProof. Assume, for a contradiction, that there exists an natural number greater than 1 that does not have a prime divisor. Then since the set of all natural numbers greater than 1 without a prime divisor is nonempty, the Well-Ordering Axiom states that this set must have a least positive natural number, say \\(n,\\) that does not have a prime divisor and is greater than 1. Since \\(n\\) does not have a prime divisor and \\(n\\) divides \\(n\\), \\(n\\) must not be prime. Thus, \\(n=a b\\) and since \\(a<n,\\) \\(a\\) must have a prime divisor and similarly for \\(b.\\) Therefore, \\(n=a b\\) must have a prime divisor. This contradiction, leads us to the desired conclusion that every natural number greater than 1 must have a prime divisor .\n\nThe following proof of the infinitude of primes is a great example of what is called proof by contradiction . The idea is to suppose that there are finitely many prime numbers, and then use these primes to create another natural number whose prime divisor can not be in the original list of all prime numbers.\n\nTheorem 2.2 (Euclid) There are infinitely many primes.\n\n\nProof. Assume that the prime numbers are listed in ascending order with \\(p_1=2,\\) \\(p_2=3,\\) \\(p_3=5,\\) and so on; and assume (for a contradiction) that \\(p_k\\) is the last prime. Consider the natural number,\n\\[\nP=p_1p_2\\cdots p_k+1.\n\\] Since every positive natural number greater than 1 has a prime divisor, \\(P\\) has a prime divisor, say \\(p_m.\\) However, \\(p_m\\) can not divide \\(P\\) since \\(P\\) is of the form, \\(P=c p_m+1.\\) Therefore \\(p_k\\), the last prime number, cannot exist."

    "text": "2.4 Greatest Common Divisors\nPerhaps the most useful result concerning great common divisors is Bezout’s lemma. This fact states that the greatest common divisor of two integers is always a linear combination of these two integers. In fact we can say more, the greatest common divisor of two given integers is always the least positive linear combination of these two integers.\n\nDefinition 2.3 Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be two integers that are not both zero. Then the greatest common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the largest integer that divides both \\(a\\) and \\(b.\\) The greatest common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is denoted by \\((a,b)\\) or sometimes by \\(\\gcd (a,b).\\)\n\nThe integers 4 and 8 have greatest common divisor of 4 and we write \\((4,8)=4\\) since 4 is the largest integer that divides both 4 and 8. Also \\((23,2)=1\\) and \\((9,51)=3.\\)\n\nDefinition 2.4 A linear combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is an integer of the form \\(m a+n b\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers.\n\nNote that given 2 and 51 we can form many different linear combinations, here are three examples: \\[\n3(2)+7(51)=363,\n\\qquad\n3(2)-7(51)=-351,\n\\] and \\(-31(2)+0(51)=-62.\\) The connection between liner combination and greatest command visors is Bezout’s identity .\n\nTheorem 2.3 (Bezout’s Identity) Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be integers, not both zero.

To represent \\(n\\) as the sum of two relatively prime integers greater than one, let \\(n=12k+h,\\) \\(0\\leq h<12.\\) We now examine the twelve cases, one for each possible value of \\(h,\\) in the following tables:\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|c}\nh & n \\\\ \\hline\n0 & (6k-1)+(6k+1) \\\\\n1 & (6k-1)+(6k+2) \\\\\n2 & (6k-1)+(6k+3) \\\\\n3 & (6k+1)+(6k+2) \\\\\n4 & (6k+2)+(6k+2) \\\\\n5 & (6k+2)+(6k+3)\n\\end{array}\\]\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|c}\nh & n \\\\ \\hline\n6 & (6k+1)+(6k+5) \\\\\n7 & (6k+2)+(6k+5) \\\\\n8 & (6k+3)+(6k+5) \\\\\n9 & (12k+7)+2 \\\\\n10 & (12k+7)+3 \\\\\n11 & (12k+9)+2\n\\end{array}\\]\nSo for all possible cases very positive integer greater than 6 is the sum of two relatively prime integers greater than 1.\n\n\nCorollary 2.3 Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be integers, then \\((a,b)=1\\) if and only if there exists integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\(a m+b n=1\\).\n\n\nProof.

    "text": "2.5 Euclidean Algorithm\nDivide \\(a\\) by \\(b,\\) obtaining the quotient \\(q_1\\) and the remainder \\(r_1\\). Then, if \\(r_1\\) is not zero, divide \\(b\\) by \\(r_1\\) obtaining the quotient \\(q_2\\) and remainder \\(r_2\\). Then if \\(r_2\\) is not zero then we repeat this process and divide \\(r_1\\) by \\(r_2\\), obtaining the quotient \\(q_3\\) and remainder \\(r_3\\). This process, or algorithm, is repeated until we first obtain the remainder of zero. At the conclusion of the process we have the greatest common divisor which is the last nonzero remainder.\nThe next lemma is used in the proof of the Euclidean Algorithm.\n\nLemma 2.7 If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers. If \\(a=b q+r\\) for some positive integers \\(q\\) and \\(r\\), then \\((a,b)=(b,r)\\).\n\nFor example, in the case that \\(288=40(7)+8\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*}\nS& =\\{d\\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid d\\mid 288 \\text{ and } d\\mid 40\\} \\\\\n& =\\{\\pm1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4\\pm, 8\\pm\\}\n\\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*}\nT& =\\{d\\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid d\\mid 40 \\text{ and } d\\mid 8\\} \\\\\n& =\\{\\pm1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4\\pm, 8\\pm\\}\n\\end{align*}\\] Clearly, \\(S=T\\) and both sets are finite.\n\nProof. Assume \\(a=bq+r\\). Let \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) be the set of common divisors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and of \\(b\\) and \\(r\\), respectively; that is, \\[\nS=\\{d\\in \\mathbb{Z} : d\\mid a \\text{ and } d\\mid b\\}\n\\quad \\text{and}\\quad\nT=\\{d\\in \\mathbb{Z} : d\\mid b \\text{ and } d\\mid r\\}.\n\\] Let \\(d\\in S\\). So \\(d\\) divides \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and thus divides \\(b\\) and \\(r=a-b q\\). Hence \\(d\\in T\\).\nTo show the reverse inclusion \\(T\\supseteq S\\), if \\(d\\in T\\) then \\(d\\) divides \\(b\\) and \\(r\\). Then \\(d\\) divides \\(a=bq+r\\) and \\(b\\), and so \\(d\\in S\\).\nWe have shown \\(S\\subseteq T\\) and \\(T\\subseteq S\\); and therefore, \\(S=T\\). Since these are finite sets the greatest common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the same as the greatest common divisor of \\(b\\) and \\(r\\).\n\n\nExample 2.8 Find \\((345688, 245994)\\).\n\n\nSolution. By the Division Algorithm, \\[\\begin{align*}\n& 345688 =245994(1)+99694 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 99694 < 245994 \\\\\n& 245994 =99694(2)+46606 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 46606 < 99694 \\\\\n& 99694 =46606(2)+6482 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 6482 < 46606 \\\\\n& 46606 =6482(7)+1232 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 1232 < 6482 \\\\\n& 6482 =1232(5)+322 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 322 < 1232 \\\\\n& 1232 =322(3)+266 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 266 < 322 \\\\\n& 322 =266(1)+56 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 56 < 266 \\\\\n& 266 =56(4)+42 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 42 < 56 \\\\\n& 56 =42(1)+14 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 14 < 42 \\\\\n& 42  =14(3)+0 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 0 < 14\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, \\((345688, 245994)=14\\).\n\n\nExample 2.9 Let \\(d=(328,288)\\). Find \\(d\\) and write it as a linear combination of 328 and 288.\n\n\nSolution. By the Division Algorithm, \\[\\begin{align*}\n328 & =288(1)+40 \\, \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 40<288 \\\\\n288 & =40(7)+8 \\,  \\text{with} \\, 0\\leq 8<40 \\\\\n40 & =8(5)+0 \\,  \\text{ with } \\, 0\\leq 8<40\n\\end{align*}\\] Now, \\(d=(328,288)=8\\) follows from \\[\n(328,288)=(288,40)=(40,8)=(8,0)=8\n\\] by \\(\\ref{euallemm}\\). We can use the above computation to write \\(8\\) as a line recombination of 328 and 288 using back substitution: \\[\\begin{align*}\n& 8=288-40(7) \\\\\n& 8=288-[328-288(1)](7) \\\\\n& 8= 8(288)-7(328)\n\\square\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nOne way to view the Euclidean algorithm is as the repeated application of the Division Algorithm and repeated application of \\(\\ref{euallemm}\\).\nWe can visualize the greatest common divisor. For example, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60.\nThe greatest common divisor of two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used multiple times, but only as long as the product of these factors divides both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). For example, since 1386 can be factored into \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 11\\), and 3213 can be factored into \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 17\\), the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals \\(63 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 7\\), the product of their shared prime factors. In particular, if two numbers have no prime factors in common, they are relatively prime.\n\nA important feature of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the gcd efficiently without having to compute the prime factors.\n\nFactorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many modern cryptography systems is based upon its infeasibility.\nConsider the question of finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. For example, let \\(a=288\\) and \\(b=3266\\), what is \\((3266,288)\\)? We apply the Division Algorithm and \\(\\ref{euallemm}\\) to obtain \\[\n3266=11(288)+98  \\text{ with } 0\\leq 98 <288 \\text{ and } (3266,288)=(288,98).\n\\] Again, we apply the Division Algorithm and \\(\\ref{euallemm}\\) to obtain \\[\n288=2(98)+92 \\text{ with } 0\\leq 92 <98 \\text{ and } (3266,288)=(288,98)=(98,92).\n\\] Again, we apply the Division Algorithm and \\(\\ref{euallemm}\\) to obtain \\[\n98=1(92)+6\n\\text{ with } 0\\leq 6 <92\n\\text{ and } (3266,288)\n%=(288,98)=(98,92)\n=(92,6)\n=2.\n\\] We now write this process in a general format.\n\nTheorem 2.6 Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be positive positive integers with \\(a\\geq b\\). If \\(b\\nmid a\\), then apply the division algorithm repeatedly as follows:\n{2} & & & \\ & & & \\ & & & \nThis process ends after a finite number of steps; that is, for some \\(k\\): \\[\nr_{k-2}=r_{k-1} q_k+r_k\n\\text{ with } 0\\leq  r_k<r_{k-1}\n\\] where $r_{k-1}=r_k q_{k+1}+0 $ and \\(r_k=(a,b)\\).\n\n\nProof. The proof follows from the property: if \\(a=b q+r,\\) then \\((a,b)=(b,r).\\) Thus, if \\(b|a,\\) then \\(a=b q+0\\) and so \\((a,b)=(b,0)=b.\\) Notice \\[\n(a,b)\n=\\left(b,r_0\\right)\n=\\left(r_0,r_1\\right)\n=\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot =\\left(r_{k-2},r_{k-1}\\right)\n=\\left(r_{k-1},r_k\\right) =\\left(r_k,0\\right) =r_k.\n\\] by \\(\\ref{euallemm}\\) as desired.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm led to the development of new number systems, such as Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers."

    "text": "3.2 Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, also called the unique factorization theorem or the unique-prime-factorization theorem, states that every integer greater than 1 is either is prime itself or is the product of prime numbers, and that, although the order of the primes in the second case is arbitrary, the primes themselves are not.\n\nTheorem 3.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) Every natural number greater than 1 can be written uniquely in the form \\[\\begin{equation}\nn=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k}\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(p_1 < p_2 < \\cdots < p_k\\) are prime numbers and \\(e_1, e_2, ... , e_k\\) are natural numbers.\n\n\nProof. Every natural number has a prime factorization by Theorem \\(\\ref{lemmaprime}\\). Thus existence is proven. Now we prove uniqueness. If there is an natural number greater than 1 for which the factorization is not unique, then by the Well-Ordering Axiom there exists a smallest such natural number, say \\(m.\\) Assume that \\(m\\) has two prime factorizations say \\[\nm=p_1{}^{\\alpha _1}p_2^{\\alpha _2}\\cdots p_s^{\\alpha _s}\n\\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad\nm=q_1^{\\beta _1}q_2^{\\beta _2}\\cdots  q_t^{\\beta _t},\n\\] where \\[\np_1<p_2< \\cdots <p_s\n\\qquad\nq_1<q_2< \\cdots <q_t\n\\] and the \\(\\alpha _i\\) and \\(\\beta _j\\) are all positive for \\(0\\leq i\\leq s\\) and \\(0\\leq j\\leq t.\\) By Theorem \\(\\ref{primechar}\\), \\[\nq_1\\mid p_{i^*} \\text{ for some } 1\\leq  i^*\\leq  s\n\\quad \\text{ and } \\quad\np_1\\mid q_{j^*} \\text{ for some } 1\\leq j^*\\leq t.\n\\] Since all the numbers \\(p_i\\) and \\(q_j\\) are prime, we must have \\(q_1=p_{i^*}\\) and \\(p_1=q_{j^*}.\\) Then \\(i^*=j^*=1\\) since \\[\nq_1\\leq q_{j^*}=p_1\\leq p_{i^*}=q_1.\n\\] Let \\(u\\) be the natural number defined as \\[\nu=\\frac{m}{p_1}=\\frac{m}{q_1}=p_1{}^{\\alpha _1-1}p_2{}^{\\alpha _2}\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot p_s{}^{\\alpha _s}=q_1{}^{\\beta _1-1}q_2{}^{\\beta_2}\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot q_t{}^{\\beta _t}.\n\\] If \\(u=1,\\) then \\(m=p_1\\) has a unique factorization contrary to hypothesis.

Both cases reveal that \\(m\\) can not exist as desired.\n\n\nExample 3.2 Show there are infinitely many primes of the form \\(4n+3.\\)\n\n\nSolution. First notice that the product of any two natural numbers of the form \\(4n+1\\) also has the form \\(4n+1\\) which can be seen by letting \\(a=4s+1\\) and \\(b=4r+1\\) where \\(s\\) and \\(r\\) are natural numbers, then\n\\[\na b=(4s+1)(4r+1)=16 r s+4 r+4 s+1=4(4 r s+r+s)+1.\n\\] We assume there are only a finite number of primes of the form \\(4k+3,\\) say \\(p_0=3,p_1, ... ,p_n\\) is all of them; and we consider the natural number\n\\[\nQ=4p_1p_2\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot p_n+3.\n\\] Notice that the prime factorization of \\(Q\\), namely \\(Q=q_1\\cdots q_t\\cdots q_m\\) must contain at least one prime of the form \\(4k+3\\) because otherwise \\(Q\\) would be of the form \\(4k+1.\\) Thus, there is one prime in the prime factorization of \\(Q\\) that is of the form \\(4k+3\\) say \\(q_t.\\) Either \\(q_t=3\\) or \\(q_t>3.\\) If \\(q_t=3,\\) then \\(3|Q\\) which means \\(3|(Q-3)\\) and so \\(3\\left|4p_1\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot p_n\\right.\\) which is absurd. If \\(q_t>3,\\) then \\(q_t=p_j\\) for some \\(1\\leq j\\leq n\\) and so \\(\\left.q_t\\right|Q\\) implies \\(q_t|Q-4p_1\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot p_n=3,\\) which is also absurd. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes of the form \\(4n+3.\\)\n\n\nDefinition 3.1 The least common multiple of two nonzero natural numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the smallest positive natural number that is divisible by \\(a\\) and \\(b.\\)\n\nThe least common multiple of \\(15\\) and 21 is \\([15,21]=105.\\) The least common multiple of \\(24\\) and 36 is \\([24,36]=72.\\) The least common multiple of 2 and 20 is \\([2,20]=20.\\) The least common multiple of 7 and 11 is \\([7,11]=77.\\)\n\nCorollary 3.1 Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be natural numbers.

    "text": "4.1 Introduction to Congruence\nIn ``Linear Congruence Equations (Fundamental Concepts and Principles)“, the author takes the reader on a comprehensive tour of linear congruence equations and their many applications. The book is ideal for students who want to deepen their knowledge of mathematics as well as professionals who need to use linear congruence equations in their work. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the concepts underlying linear congruence equations, making it an essential resource for anyone looking to understand this important topic.\nCongruence in the integers means that two numbers are equivalent if their difference is a multiple of a certain number, called the modulus. In other words, we can say that two numbers are congruent modulo m if they have the same remainder when divided by m. For example, 17 and 29 are Congruent modulo 4 because the remainders when we divide them by 4 are 1 and 1 respectively.\nCongruence is an equivalence relation, which means that it satisfies the three properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. There are also several lemmas about congruence which we will now state without proof. The first one says that if a is congruent to b modulo m and c is congruent to d modulo m then a+c is congruent to b+d modulo m.\nThe second lemma states that if a is congruent to b modulo m and c is any integer then a+c is congruent to b+c modulo m. The third and final lemma says that if a is congruent to b modulo m then ac is congruent to bc modulo m. These lemmas show that congruent behaves nicely with addition, subtraction, and multiplication and so it should be clear why it is such a useful concept.\nModular arithmetic is a system that involves the remainders of the division of certain numbers. It is often referred to as “clock arithmetic” because of its similarity to how hours are measured on a clock. The numbers in modular arithmetic are called “objects” and the remainders are called “residues”. The concept of modular arithmetic can be difficult to grasp at first, but it is actually quite simple.\nIn many applications, it is important to know not only the value of x modulo n, but also its least positive residue. For example, in computer science, when working with very large numbers that are too large to fit into a single data type, it is often necessary to store only the least significant digits of the number; and when performing arithmetic operations on such numbers, it is often necessary to reduce them modulo some number n that is a power of two (such as 216 = 65536), so that they can be stored in a smaller data type. In both cases, it suffices to know only the least positive residue of x modulo n.\nIn this chapter, we explain what congruence (modular arithmetic) is in the integers. We also provide some examples to illustrate how it works. Least positive residues are an important part of understanding modular arithmetic. We hope that by the end of this chapter, you will have a good understanding of both least positive residues and congruence in the integers.\nIn mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system that allows numbers to be divided into congruent classes. This means that the remainders of two numbers when divided by a third number are the same. For example, when we divide 7 by 3, the remainder is 1; when we divide 8 by 3, the remainder is 2; and when we divide 9 by 3, the remainder is 0. In modular arithmetic, these three numbers would be said to be congruent modulo 3.\nModular arithmetic is particularly useful in computer science because it can be used to represent data in a more efficient way. For example, instead of storing the full date (December 21st, 2015), a computer can store just the day of the month (21) and the year (2015). This is possible because we know that there are only 31 days in December, so the modular arithmetic system allows us to store the information more efficiently.\nOverall, modular arithmetic is a powerful tool that can be used in a variety of ways. It is particularly useful for computer science applications, but it can also be used for other purposes as well.\nIn this chapter, we will explain what congruence (modular arithmetic) in the integers is and how it works.\nLinear congruence is an equation that produces a set of integers that are evenly spaced apart. The equation has the form \\(ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\), where a, b, and n are integers and n > 0. Linear congruence equations are very powerful tools that can be used to solve various mathematical problems. In fact, they are so versatile that they have even been used to crack codes!\nOne way to solve for x is to find the modular inverse of a modulo m. This can be done using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Once the modular inverse is found, it can be plugged into the equation to solve for x.\nThe Euclidean algorithm is a fast and straightforward way to solve these equations. Given an equation \\(ax \\equiv b \\pmod{m}\\), we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find a solution in just a few steps. First, we find the greatest common divisor of a and m using the Euclidean algorithm. Then, we divide b by this greatest common divisor to get an integer c. Finally, we use the Extended Euclidean algorithm to find a number d such that \\(ad \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}\\). Plugging in these values for x in our original equation gives us the solution: \\(x \\equiv cd \\pmod{m}\\). By using the Euclidean algorithm, we can quickly and easily solve linear congruence equations.\nLinear congruence equations are a powerful tool that can be used to solve many different types of problems. With a little practice, anyone can learn how to use them.\nThese equations have a solution if and only if a and m are relatively prime. If an equation has a solution, then all solutions can be found by repeated addition of m to any one solution. In particular, if x is a solution of the equation, then so are x + km for any integer k. The set of all solutions of the equation is called the residue class of x (modulo m).\nIn this chapter, you’ll learn that two numbers in the same residue class modulo m give the same remainder when divided by m. For example, 7 and 17 are in the same residue class modulo 6 because they both leave the same remainder, 1, when divided by 6. On the other hand, 14 is not in this residue class because it leaves a different remainder, 2, when divided by 6.\nLinear Congruence Equations are useful in many situations, including finding the inverse of an integer with modular arithmetic. If we have an integer a such that there is no integer b for which \\(ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}\\), then there is no inverse of a (modulo m). However, if \\(ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}\\), then a has an inverse modulo m, and this inverse is given by b.\nThus, to find the inverse of an integer with modular arithmetic, we must first determine whether or not it has an inverse. We can do this by solving a linear congruence equation. In summary, in this chapter, you’ll learn that linear congruence equations are both necessary and sufficient for finding the inverse of an integer with modular arithmetic.\nThis book is a comprehensive guide to understanding linear congruence equations and their various applications. It is ideal for students who are looking to further their knowledge of mathematics and for professionals who need to use linear congruence equations in their work. The author takes the reader on a clear and concise tour of the concepts underlying linear congruence equations, making it an essential resource for anyone looking to understand this important topic. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about linear congruence equations."

    "section": "4.2 Introduction to Congruence",
    "text": "4.2 Introduction to Congruence\nA modern treatment of congruences was introduced by Karl Friedrich Gauss. Congruence, or modular arithmetic, arises naturally in common everyday situations. For example, odometers usually work modulo 100,000 and utility meters often operate modulo 1000. In trigonometry, it is common to work in degrees, that is modulo 360 degrees, and indeed, it is common to work in minutes and seconds both of which are working modulo 60.\n\nDefinition 4.1 Let \\(n\\) be a positive integer. Integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are congruent modulo \\(n\\) if \\(a-b\\) is divisible by \\(n\\) and is denoted by \\(a \\equiv b \\pmod{n}.\\)\n\nNotice \\(24\\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\\) since \\(5|(24-4)\\) but \\(24 \\not\\equiv 3 \\, \\pmod{5}\\) since \\(5\\mid (24-3)\\) does not hold. Also, \\(111\\equiv 9 \\pmod{40}\\) since \\(40|(111-9)\\) and \\(111\\not\\equiv 8 \\pmod{40}\\) since \\(40\\mid (111-8)\\) does nto hold.\nNext we show that congruence modulo \\(n\\) is an equivalence relation on the set of integers.\n\nTheorem 4.1 For each positive integer \\(n\\), congruence modulo \\(n\\) is an equivalence relation on the set of integers.\n\n\nProof. If \\(a\\) is an integer, then \\(a\\equiv a \\pmod{n}\\) since \\(n|(a-a)\\) and so \\(\\equiv\\) is reflexive. If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers and \\(a\\equiv b \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(b\\equiv a \\pmod{n}\\) since \\(n|(b-a)\\) \\(\\Longleftrightarrow\\) \\(n|(a-b)\\) and so the relation \\(\\equiv\\) is symmetric. If \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are integers, \\(a\\equiv b \\pmod{n},\\) and \\(b\\equiv c \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(a\\equiv c \\pmod{n}\\) because \\(n|(b-a)\\) and \\(n|(c-b)\\) implies \\(n|(a-c)\\) and so the relation \\(\\equiv\\) is also transitive.\n\n\nTheorem 4.2 If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, then \\(a\\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\) if and only if there exists an integer \\(k\\) such that \\(a=b+k n.\\)\n\n\nProof. If \\(a\\equiv b \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(n|(a-b)\\) and this means there exists an integer \\(k\\) such that \\(k n=a-b\\) and so \\(a=b+k n.\\) Conversely, if there is an integer \\(k\\) such that \\(a=b+k n,\\) then \\(n|(a-b)\\); and so \\(a\\equiv b \\pmod{n}.\\)\n\n\nLemma 4.1 For all integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\), if \\(a\\equiv c \\pmod{n}\\) and \\(b\\equiv d \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(a\\pm b\\equiv c\\pm d \\pmod{n}\\) and \\(a b\\equiv c d \\pmod{n}.\\)\n\n\nProof. If \\(a\\equiv c \\pmod{n}\\) and \\(b\\equiv d \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(n|a-c\\) and \\(n|b-d.\\) It follows that, \\(n|(a\\pm b)-(c\\pm d)\\) and thus \\(a\\pm b\\equiv c\\pm d \\pmod{n}.\\) It also follows that, \\(n|(a b-c b)\\) and \\(n|(c b-c d);\\) thus \\(n|(a b-c d).\\) Therefore, \\(a b\\equiv c d \\pmod{n}.\\)\n\n\nLemma 4.2 For all integers \\(a\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\), if \\(a+c\\equiv a+d \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(c\\equiv d \\pmod{n}.\\)\n\n\nProof. If \\(a+c\\equiv a+d \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(n|(a+c)-(a+d)\\) and so \\(n|c-d\\) which means \\(c\\equiv d \\pmod{n}.\\)\n\n\nLemma 4.3 For all integers \\(a\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\), if \\(a c\\equiv a d \\pmod{n}\\) and \\((a,n)=1,\\) then \\(c\\equiv d \\pmod{n}.\\)\n\n\nProof. If \\(a c\\equiv a d \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(n|(a c-a d)\\) which means \\(n|a(c-d).\\) Since \\((a,n)=1,\\) it follow that \\(n|(c-d)\\) and so \\(c\\equiv d \\pmod{n}.\\)\n\n\nLemma 4.4 For all integers \\(a\\), there exists an integer \\(h\\) such that \\(a h\\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\) if and only if \\((a,n)=1.\\)\n\n\nProof. If \\((a,n)=1,\\) then there exists integers \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) such that \\(s a+t n=1.\\) Let \\(h=s,\\) then \\(a h\\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\) as desired. Conversely, if there is such a \\(h\\) then \\(a h=1+q n\\) for some \\(q.\\) Thus, \\(a h+(-q) n=1\\) and so \\((a,n)=1.\\)\n\n\nLemma 4.5 For all integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), if \\(a c\\equiv b c \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(a\\equiv b \\pmod{n/(c,n)}.\\)\n\n\nProof. If \\(a c\\equiv b c \\pmod{n},\\) we know that \\(n|(a c-b c)=c(a-b).\\) Thus there exists an integer \\(k\\) such that \\(c(a-b)=k n\\) and dividing both sides by \\(d=(c,n),\\) we have \\((c/d)(a-b)=k(n/d).\\) Because \\((n/d,c/d)=1\\) it follows that \\((n/d)|(a-b).\\) Therefore, \\(a\\equiv b \\pmod{n/(c,n)}.\\)\n\n\nLemma 4.6 For all integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), if \\(k,n>0\\) and \\(a\\equiv b \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(a^k\\equiv b^k \\pmod{n}.\\)\n\n\nProof. Because \\(a\\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\) we have by definition, \\(n|(a-b)\\) and since \\[\na^k-b^k=(a-b)\\left(a^{k-1}+a^{k-2}b+\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot +a b^{k-2}+b^{k-1}\\right)\n\\] we see that \\((a-b)\\left|\\left(a^k-b^k\\right)\\right.;\\) whence \\(n\\left|\\left(a^k-b^k\\right).\\right.\\) Therefore, \\(a^k\\equiv b^k\\) \\(\\pmod{n}.\\)\n\n\nDefinition 4.2 Given a modulus \\(n\\) and an integer \\(a\\) the least positive residue of \\(a\\) modulo \\(n\\) is the smallest positive integer \\(r\\) such that \\(a\\equiv r \\pmod{n}.\\)\n\nFor example, the remainder of \\(n\\) when divided by 9 is the same as the remainder of the sum of its digits when divided by 9 which follows from writing \\(n=d_t10^t+d_{t-1}10^{t-1}+\\ldots +d_110+d_0\\) where \\(0\\leq d_i\\leq 9\\) by noting that \\(10^k\\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}\\) for any \\(k.\\) Notice also that the remainder of \\(n\\) when divided by 11 is the same as the remainder of the alternating sum of its digits when divided by 11 which follows from writing \\(n\\) in decimal form and noting that \\(10^k\\equiv (-1)^k \\pmod{11}\\) for any \\(k.\\)\nLet \\(\\{0,1,2, ... ,n-1\\}\\) be a complete set of on \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) for congruence modulo \\(n,\\) then define \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\text{:=}\\{[1],[2],[3], ... ,[n-1]\\}\\) and define the operation \\(+\\) on \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\) by \\([a]+[b]=[a+b].\\) Arithmetic using this operation is referred to as equivalence class representatives} on \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) for congruence modulo \\(n,\\) then define \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\text{:=}\\{[1],[2],[3], ... ,[n-1]\\}\\) and define the operation \\(+\\) on \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\) by \\([a]+[b]=[a+b].\\) Arithmetic using this operation is referred to as \\index{modular arithmetic .\nThe operation \\(+\\) is a well-defined binary operation; meaning, if \\([a]=[b]\\) and \\([c]=[d]\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\), then \\([a]+[b]=[a+b]=[c+d]=[c]+[d]\\) which follows from \\(a\\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\) and \\(c\\equiv d \\pmod{n} \\Rightarrow a+c\\equiv b+d \\pmod{n}.\\) For example, the arithmetic tables for \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{6}\\) are \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1}\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n+ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5  & 0 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n4 & 4 & 5 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n5 & 5 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\n\\end{array}\n& &\n\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1}\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n\\times & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  & 5 \\\\\n2 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 4 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n4 & 0 & 4 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n5 & 0 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1\n\\end{array}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nTheorem 4.3 Let \\(n\\) be a positive integer, then \\(+\\) is associative and commutative, each element has an inverse, and \\([0]\\) is the identity element.\n\n\nProof. By the definition of \\(+\\) and the use of associativity in the integers, it follows that \\[\\begin{align*}\n[a]+([b]+[c])& =[a]+[b+c] =[a+(b+c)]=[(a+b)+c] \\\\\n&=[a+b]+[c]=([a]+[b])+[c]\n\\end{align*}\\] for any \\([a],\\) \\([b],\\) and \\([c]\\in \\mathbb{Z}_n.\\) The element \\([0]\\) is the identity because \\[\n[a]+[0]=[a+0] [a]\n\\] for any \\([a]\\in \\mathbb{Z}_n.\\) For every element \\([a]\\) of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\) there is an inverse because \\[\n[a]+[-a] =[a+(-a)]=[0]\n\\] and indeed \\([-a]\\in \\mathbb{Z}_n.\\) Commutativity follows since \\[\n[a]+[b]=[a+b]=[b+a]=[b]+[a]\n\\] for \\([a],\\) \\([b]\\in \\mathbb{Z}_n.\\)\n\n\nTheorem 4.4 Let \\(n\\) be a positive integer.

For larger integer values of n, Fermat’s Last Theorem states there are no positive integer solutions \\((x, y, z)\\).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nx^2-ny^2=\\pm 1\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis is Pell’s equation, which is named after the English mathematician John Pell. It was studied by Brahmagupta in the 7th century, as well as by Fermat in the 17th century.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{4}{n} = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z}   \n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe Erdos-Straus conjecture states that, for every positive integer n ? 2, there exists a solution in x, y, and z, all as positive integers. Although not usually stated in polynomial form, this example is equivalent to the polynomial equation \\(4xyz = yzn + xzn + xyn = n(yz + xz + xy)\\).\nThe term Diophantine equation usually refers to any equation in one or more unknowns that is to be solved in the integers.\nThe simplest kind of Diophantine equation is the linear Diophantine equation , namely \\(a x + b y = c\\). In general, Diophantine equations furnish a natural vehicle for puzzles and problems of a mathematical nature.\n\nTheorem 4.5 (Linear Diophantine Equation) The linear Diophantine equation \\(a x+b y=c\\) has a solution if and only if \\(d|c,\\) where \\(d=(a,b).\\) Moreover, if \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right)\\) is a solution, then the set of solutions of the equation consists of pairs \\((x,y)\\) where\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{ldequ}\nx=x_0+\\frac{t b}{d}\n\\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad\ny=y_0-\\frac{t a}{d}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nand \\(t\\) is an arbitrary integer.\n\n\nProof. Since \\(d=(a,b)\\) there exists integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\(a m+b n=d\\). Since \\(d|c\\) we have an integer \\(k\\) such that \\(c=d k\\) and thus we have \\((a m+b n)k=d k\\). Thus, \\(a (m k)+b (n k)=c\\) and so we have a solution.\nConversely, suppose \\(a x+b y=c\\) has a solution say \\(x_1\\) and \\(y_1.\\) Then \\(a x_1+b y_1=c\\) and since \\(d|a\\) and \\(d|b\\) we have \\(d|c.\\) Let \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\) be any solution. Then we have \\(a x_0+b y_0=c\\) and so\n\\[\na x_0+\\frac{t a b}{d}+b y_0-\\frac{t a b}{d}=c\n\\] for any integer \\(t.\\) Therefore, \\(\\ref{ldequ}\\) holds for any integer \\(t.\\)\n\nIt remains to show that all solutions \\((x,y)\\) have the correct form. Let \\((x,y)\\) be an arbitrary solution and let \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right)\\) be any particular solution. Then we have \\(a\\left(x-x_0\\right)+b\\left(x-x_0\\right)=0\\) and thus \\(a\\left(x-x_0\\right)=b\\left(y_0-y\\right).\\) Now enter \\(d\\). Dividing by \\(d,\\) we have\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{d}\\left(x-x_0\\right)=\\frac{b}{d}\\left(y_0-y\\right).\n\\] Observe that \\[\n\\left(\\frac{a}{d},\\frac{b}{d}\\right)=1\n\\] and so \\(\\frac{a}{d}\\mid \\left(y_0-y\\right)\\). Therefore, there exists an integer \\(s\\) such that \\(y=y_0-\\left(\\frac{a}{d}\\right)s\\) and by substitution, \\(x=x_0+\\left(\\frac{b}{d}\\right)s\\) as desired.\n\nWhile solving linear Diophantine equations are straightforward, this is not true for general Diophantine equations. In 1900, in recognition of their depth, David Hilbert proposed the solvability of all Diophantine problems as the tenth of his celebrated problems. In 1970, a novel result in mathematical logic known as Matiyasevich’s theorem settled the problem negatively: in general Diophantine problems are unsolvable.\nUsing \\(\\ref{lindiothm}\\) we can check if a linear Diophantine equations is solvable and if solvable, actually find its solutions. The key ingredient is finding a particular solution is the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nExample 4.1 Solve the linear Diophantine equation \\(14x+34y=90.\\)\n\n\nSolution. Since \\((14,34)=2\\) and \\(2|90.\\) There is a solution and they are all given by \\(\\ref{ldequ}\\) and so we need to find an initial solution. Since an initial solution is \\(x=4\\) and \\(y=1\\) we have all solutions $x=4+17 t $ and \\(y=1-7 t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n\nExample 4.2 Solve the linear Diophantine equation \\(14x+35x=91.\\)\n\n\nSolution. Since \\((14,35)=7\\) and \\(7|91\\) the equation is solvable.\nSince an initial solution is \\(x=4\\) and \\(y=1\\) we have all solutions \\(x=4+2t\\) and \\(y=1-5t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n\nExample 4.3 Solve the linear Diophantine equation \\(14x+36y=93.\\)\n\n\nSolution. Since \\((14,36)=2\\) and \\(2\\nmid 93\\) there are no solution to the linear Diophantine equation \\(14x+36y=93.\\).\n\n\nCorollary 4.1 If \\((a,b)=1\\) and if \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\) is a particular solution of the linear Diophantine equation \\(a x+b y=c,\\) then all solutions are given by \\(x=x_0+b t\\) and \\(y=y_0-a t\\) for integral values of \\(t.\\)\n\n\nProof. The proof follows mediately from \\(\\ref{lindiothm}\\).\n\nFor example, the equation \\(5x+22y=18\\) has \\(x_0=8,\\) \\(y_0=-1\\) as one solution and so a complete solution is given by \\(x=8+22t\\) and $ y=-1-5t$ for arbitrary integral values of \\(t.\\)\nA problem in Diophantus’ Arithmetica is to find four natural numbers whose sums by three are 20, 22, 24, and 27. Can you find these four integers?\n\nTheorem 4.6 (General Linear Diophantine Equation) If \\(a_1,a_2,\\ldots ,a_n\\) are nonzero positive integers, then the equation \\[\na_1x_1+ \\cdots +a_nx_n=c\n\\] has an integral solution if and only if \\(d=\\left(a_1,\\ldots ,a_n\\right)\\) divides \\(c.\\) Furthermore, when there is a solution, there are infinitely many solutions.\n\n\nProof. The proof is left for the reader.\n\n\nExample 4.4 Which combinations of pennies, dimes, and quarters have a total value of \\(99\\) cents.\n\nDiophantus made important advances in mathematical notation, becoming the first person known to use algebraic notation and symbolism. Before him everyone wrote out equations completely. Diophantus introduced an algebraic symbolism that used an abridged notation for frequently occurring operations, and an abbreviation for the unknown and for the powers of the unknown.\n\nSolution. Let \\(x,y,\\) and \\(z\\) be the number of pennies, dimes, and quarters, respectively. To solve this question we will solve the linear Diophantine equation: \\(x+10y+25z=99.\\) Since \\(x,y,\\) and \\(z\\) are all positive integers, it follows that \\(z=0,1,2,3;\\) and so we can solve the 4 corresponding equations in only \\(x\\) and \\(y.\\) First, we solve \\(x+10y=99.\\) Clearly, \\(x_0=99\\) and \\(y_0=0\\) is a particular solution and since \\((1,10)=1\\) all solutions are given by \\(x=99+10t\\) and \\(y=0-t.\\) By letting \\(t\\) range from 0 to \\(-9\\), we find some combinations of pennies, dimes, and quarters that total 99 cents:\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccccccccc}\nx & 99 & 89 & 79 & 69 & 59 & 49 & 39 & 29 & 19 & 9 \\\\  \\hline\ny & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\\\ \\hline\nz & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\hline\nt & 0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4 & -5 & -6 & -7 & -8 & -9\n\\end{array}\\]\nNext, we solve \\(x+10y=74.\\) Clearly, \\(x_0=74\\) and \\(y_0=0\\) is a particular solution and since \\((1,10)=1\\) all solutions are given by \\(x=74+10t\\) and \\(y=0-t.\\) By letting \\(t\\) range from 0 to \\(-7\\), we find more combinations of pennies, dimes, and quarters that total 99 cents:\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}\nx & 74 & 64 & 54 & 44 & 34 & 24 & 14 & 4 \\\\ \\hline\ny & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\\\ \\hline\nz & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \\hline\nt & 0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4 & -5 & -6 & -7\n\\end{array}\\]\nNext, we solve \\(x+10y=49.\\) Clearly, \\(x_0=49\\) and \\(y_0=0\\) is a particular solution and since \\((1,10)=1\\) all solutions are given by \\(x=49+10t\\) and \\(y=0-t.\\) By letting \\(t\\) range from 0 to \\(-4\\), we find more combinations of pennies, dimes, and quarters that total 99 cents:\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\nx & 49 & 39 & 29 & 19 & 9 \\\\ \\hline\ny & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\ \\hline\nz & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\ \\hline\nt & 0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4\n\\end{array}\n\\hspace{1cm}\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\nx & 24 & 14 & 4 \\\\ \\hline\ny & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ \\hline\nz & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\ \\hline\nt & 0 & -1 & -2\n\\end{array}\\]\nFinally, we solve \\(x+10y=24.\\) Clearly, \\(x_0=24\\) and \\(y_0=0\\) is a particular solution and since \\((1,10)=1\\) all solutions are given by \\(x=49+10t\\) and \\(y=0-t.\\) By letting \\(t\\) range from 0 to \\(-2\\), we find even more combinations of pennies, dimes, and quarters that total 99 cents."

    "text": "4.5 Linear Congruence Equations\n\nDefinition 4.3 Given integers \\(a, b\\) and a modulus \\(n,\\) a congruence equation of the form \\(a x\\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\) is called a linear congruence where \\(x\\) is an unknown.\n\nSolvability of a linear congruence \\(a x\\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\) can easily be described by the following: (i) if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime then there is precisely one incongruent solution modulo \\(n\\), (ii) if the greatest common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) does not divide \\(b\\), then the linear congruence has no solution, and (iii) if the gcd of \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) does divide \\(b\\) then there are exactly \\((a,n)\\) distinct incongruent solutions modulo \\(n\\). Knowing whether there are solutions to a given linear congruence is often the first step, but as we will see, the work of computing \\((a,n)\\) can be also used in finding solutions, if there are any.\n\nTheorem 4.7  Let \\(x\\) be an unknown in the linear congruence equation \\(a x\\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\) and \\(d=(a,n)\\).\n\nIf \\(d=1,\\) then there is precisely one solution.\n\nIf \\(d|b\\) there are exactly \\(d\\) distinct solutions, otherwise there are no solutions.\n\n\n\nProof. By the Euclidean algorithm there are integers \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) such that \\(a s+n t=1,\\) and then \\(a (s b)+n(t b)=b\\) and thus we find that \\(x=s b\\) is a solution of the congruence. If \\(y\\) is any other solution, then \\(a y\\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\). Thus, \\(a x\\equiv a y \\pmod{n}\\) and since \\((a,n)=1\\) we have \\(x\\equiv y \\pmod{n}\\).\nSince the congruence is equivalent to \\(a x+n(- y)=b\\) in integers \\(x\\) and \\(y,\\) the existence of solutions \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) requires that \\(d=(a,n)\\) divide \\(b\\). Suppose then that this requirement is satisfied and let \\(x=x_0+(n/d)t\\) and \\(y=y_0+(a/d)t\\) where \\(x=x_0\\) and \\(y=y_0\\) is a particular solution, be all solutions to \\(a x+n(- y)=b\\). Therefore, for any integer \\(t,\\) \\(x\\) is a solution to \\(a x\\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\).\nTo determine that there are \\(d\\) incongruent solutions, we find the condition that describes when two solutions are congruent modulo \\(n\\). Suppose we have two solutions, namely,\n\\[\nx_0+\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)t_1\\equiv x_0+\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)t_2  \\pmod{n}.\n\\]\nSince \\[\n\\left(\\frac{n}{d},n\\right)=\\frac{n}{d},\n\\] it follows that \\(t_1\\equiv t_2 \\pmod{d}\\). This show that a complete set of incongruent solutions is obtained by taking \\(x=x_0+\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)t\\) and \\(t\\) ranges through a complete system of residues modulo \\(d;\\) one such set is given by \\(t=0,1,2, \\ldots ,d-1\\).\n\n\nExample 4.5 Solve the linear congruence \\(131 x\\equiv 21 \\pmod{77}\\).\n\n\nSolution. Because \\(1=(131,77)|21\\) there is a unique solution modulo 77. We have \\(54x\\equiv 21 \\pmod{77}\\) and dividing by \\(3\\) we have \\(18 x\\equiv 7 \\pmod{77}\\). Next multiplying by \\(4\\) we have \\(72 x\\equiv 28 \\pmod{77}\\) and so \\(-5x\\equiv 28\\equiv 105 \\pmod{77}\\). Therefore, \\(x\\equiv -21\\equiv 56 \\pmod{77}\\).\n\n\nExample 4.6 Solve the linear congruence \\(6x\\equiv (10)^k \\pmod{21}\\).\n\n\nSolution. There is no solution because \\((6,21)=3\\) does not divide \\(2^k5^k\\) for any positive integer \\(k\\).\n\n\nExample 4.7 Solve the linear congruence \\(91 x\\equiv 98 \\pmod{119}\\).\n\n\nSolution. Because \\(7=(91,119)|98\\) there are \\(7\\) incongruent solutions modulo \\(119\\). We use cancellation to simplify the congruence to \\(13 x\\equiv 14 \\pmod{17}\\). We have \\(-4x\\equiv -3\\equiv -20 \\pmod{17}\\). Therefore, in terms of the original modulus, the solutions are\n\\[\nx\\equiv 5, 22, 39, 56, 73, 90, 107 \\pmod{199}.\n\\square\n\\]\n\n\nExample 4.8 Solve the linear congruence \\(31 x\\equiv 12 \\pmod{24}\\).\n\n\nSolution. Since \\((31,24)=1\\) and \\(1|12\\) there is exactly one incongruent solution modulo \\(24\\). To find this solution we use \\(31\\equiv 7 \\pmod{24}\\) so \\(31 x\\equiv 7x \\pmod{24}\\) which means we now solve the linear congruence \\(7x\\equiv 12 \\pmod{24}\\). Next we multiply by 7, to obtain \\(49x\\equiv 84 \\pmod{24}\\). Then since \\(49\\equiv 1 \\pmod{24}\\) and \\(84\\equiv 12 \\pmod{24}\\) we now have \\(x\\equiv 12 \\pmod{24}\\) as our solution to the linear congruence \\(31 x\\equiv 12 \\pmod{24}\\).\n\n\nExample 4.9 Solve the linear congruence \\(987 x\\equiv 610 \\pmod{1597}\\).\n\n\nSolution. Solving the linear congruence equation is equivalent to solving the linear Diophantine equation \\(987 x+1597 (-y)=610\\) for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). There is a solution because \\((987,1597)=1\\) and it is unique modulo \\(1597\\). A particular solution is \\(x=-1\\) and \\(y=-1\\). Thus all solutions to the Diophantine equations are \\[\nx=-1+\\frac{1597}{1}t \\quad \\text{ and }  \\quad y=-1+\\frac{987}{1}t.\n\\] Suppose that\n\\[ -1+\\frac{1597}{1}t_1\\equiv -1+\\frac{1597}{1}t_2  \\pmod{1597}\n\\]\nare two solutions to the congruence equation. Then clearly, \\(t_1\\equiv t_2 \\pmod{1597}\\). This show that a complete set of incongruent solutions is obtained by taking \\(x=-1+1597t\\) and \\(t=0\\). Therefore, the unique solution is \\(x\\equiv 1596 \\pmod{1597}\\).\n\n\nExample 4.10 Solve the linear congruence \\(42 x\\equiv 50 \\pmod{76}\\).\n\n\nSolution. Solving the linear congruence equation is equivalent to solving the linear Diophantine equation \\(42 x+76(- y)=50\\) for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). There is a solution because \\((42,76)=2\\) and \\(2|50;\\) and so there are exactly two solutions modulo \\(76\\). A particular solution is \\(x=-35\\) and \\(y=20\\). Thus all solutions for \\(42 x+76(- y)=50\\) are \\[\nx=-35+\\frac{76}{2}t\n\\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad\ny=20+\\frac{42}{2}t.\n\\] Suppose that \\(-35+38t_1\\equiv -35+38t_2\\pmod{76}\\) are two solutions. Since \\((38,76)=38,\\) we have, \\(t_1\\equiv t_2 \\pmod{2}\\). This show that a complete set of incongruent solutions is obtained by taking \\(x=-35+38t\\) and \\(t=0,1,2, \\ldots ,d-1\\) where \\(d=(42,76)=2\\). Therefore, the solutions are \\(x\\equiv 3 \\pmod{76}\\) and \\(x\\equiv 41 \\pmod{76}\\).\n\nNotice that to solve a linear congruence equation \\(a x\\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\) we find, (if possible) an integer \\(h\\) such that \\(a h\\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\) and then using \\(h\\) we solve by multiplying by \\(h\\), obtaining \\(x\\equiv h b \\pmod{n}\\).\n\nDefinition 4.4 Let \\(a\\) be an integer with \\((a,n)=1\\). Then a solution of the linear congruence \\(a x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\) is called an inverse of \\(a\\).\n\n\nTheorem 4.8 Let \\(p\\) be a prime. The positive integer \\(a\\) is its own inverse modulo \\(p\\) if and only if \\(a\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\) or \\(a\\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}\\).\n\n\nProof. If \\(a\\) is its own inverse modulo \\(p,\\) then \\(a^2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\). Thus, \\(p\\left|\\left(a^2-1\\right)\\right.\\) and so either \\(p|(a-1)\\) or \\(p|(a+1)\\). Therefore, \\(a\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\) or \\(a\\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}\\). Conversely, if \\(a\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\) or \\(a\\equiv -1 \\pmod{p},\\) then \\(a^2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p},\\) so that \\(a\\) is its own inverse modulo \\(p\\).\n\n\nExample 4.11 By finding an inverse, solve the linear congruence \\(37x\\equiv b \\pmod{53}\\).\n\n\nSolution. First we solve, \\(37 x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{53}\\). We have \\(-16x\\equiv 1\\equiv 54 \\pmod{53}\\). Now dividing by \\(2\\) and simplifying, we have \\(8x\\equiv -27\\equiv 26\\equiv 132 \\pmod{53}\\) Again dividing by \\(2\\) and simplifying, we have \\(2x\\equiv 33\\equiv 86 \\pmod{53}\\) Therefore, \\(x\\equiv 43 \\pmod{53}\\). Now to solve \\(37 x\\equiv b \\pmod{53}\\) we multiply by \\(43\\) and we have \\((43) 37 x\\equiv 43 b \\pmod{53}\\). Thus \\(x\\equiv 43 b \\pmod{53}\\) is the solution.\n\n\nExample 4.12 By finding an inverse, solve the linear congruence \\(31 x\\equiv 12 \\pmod{24}\\).\n\n\nSolution. Recall that since \\((31,24)=1\\) and \\(1|12\\) there is exactly one incongruent solution modulo \\(24\\). To find this solution let’s use the definition of congruence, namely \\(24|(31x-12)\\) which means there exists an integer \\(y\\) such that \\(31x-12=24y\\) and so we will solve the linear Diophantine equation \\(31x+24(-y)=12\\). Now notice that we merely need the \\(x\\) solutions because of our original linear congruence involves only \\(x\\). But first we need a particular solution to this linear Diophantine equation, which can be found using the Euclidean algorithm, \\(31=1(24)+7\\) with \\(0\\leq 7<24\\) \\(24=3(7)+3,\\) with \\(0\\leq 2<7\\) \\(7=2(3)+1\\), with \\(0\\leq 1<2\\) so \\((31,24)=1\\) which we already knew but now we can use back substitution to find 1 as a linear combination of \\(31\\) and \\(24,\\) namely, \\(1=7-2(3)\\), \\(1=7-2(24-3(7))\\), \\(1=(7)7+(-2)(24)\\), \\(1=(7)(31-1(24))+(-2)(24)\\), \\(1=(7)(31)+(-9)(24)\\). Then multiplying by 12 yields a particular solution with \\(x_0=84\\) since, \\(12=(31)(84)+(24)(-108)\\), So all solutions to the linear Diophantine equation \\(31x+24(-y)=12\\) are given \\(x=84+24t\\) where \\(t\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). In particular when \\(t=-3\\) we find the solution \\(x\\equiv 12 \\pmod{24}\\).\n\n\nExample 4.13 By finding an inverse, solve the linear congruence \\(78 x\\equiv 12 \\pmod{240}\\).\n\n\nSolution. Since \\((78,240)=6\\) and \\(6|12\\) there are exactly six incongruent solution modulo \\(240\\). To find these solutions let’s use the definition of congruence, namely \\(240|(78x-12)\\) which means there exists an integer \\(y\\) such that \\(78x-12=240y\\) and so we will solve the linear Diophantine equation \\(78x+240(-y)=12\\). Using the Euclidean algorithm, \\(240=3(78)+6, \\text{with} 0\\leq 7<24\\) and now we can write 6 as a linear combination of \\(78\\) and \\(240,\\) namely, \\(6=(-3)(78)+(1)(240)\\) Then multiplying by 2 yields a particular solution with \\(x_0=-6\\) since,\n\\(12=(-6)(78)+(2)(240)\\), So all solutions to the linear Diophantine equation \\(78x-12=240y\\) are given\n\\(x=-6+\\frac{240}{6}t=-6+40t\\) where \\(t\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). In particular, when \\(t=1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\) we find the six incongruent solutions modulo 240, \\(x\\equiv 34,74,114,154,194 ,234 \\pmod{240}\\).\n\n\nExample 4.14 For which integers \\(c,\\) \\(0\\leq c\\leq 1001,\\) does the congruence \\(154x\\equiv c \\pmod{1001}\\) have solutions? When there are solutions, how many incongruent solutions are there?"

This theorem has been used for centuries to help mathematicians solve complex problems, and it’s an essential tool for anyone looking to pursue a career in mathematics. In this Definitive Guide, you’ll learn everything you need to know about the Chinese Remainder Theorem, from its history to its many applications.\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem is a mathematical theorem that states that if there are a certain number of integers that are all coprime to each other, then for any integer N that is congruent to each modulo ni, there is exactly one such congruence class modulo M. In other words, the Chinese Remainder Theorem allows you to solve a system of linear congruence equations with a unique solution. The Chinese Remainder Theorem is an important tool in number theory and has a wide range of applications, including cryptography and computer science.\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem is a mathematical theorem with a wide range of applications. In its simplest form, the theorem states that if one knows the remainders of a number when it is divided by a set of co-prime numbers, then one can determine the number itself. The theorem has a wide range of applications, from helping to solve simple arithmetic problems to more complex applications in cryptography and computer science. For example, the Chinese Remainder Theorem can be used to find the last digit of a very large number, something that is often useful in mathematical contests. It can also be used to design algorithms for factoring large numbers, a critical task in cryptography.\nChinese Remainder Theorem is a mathematics theorem that helps one to find the value of a certain number when its value is unknown. It was developed by Chinese mathematician Sun Zi during the 3rd century BC, and it has since been used by mathematicians and scientists all over the world. \nChinese Remainder Theorem is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of mathematical problems. However, it is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is that it can be difficult to find the values of x that satisfy all the congruences.\nThis can be particularly tricky when there are a large number of congruences. Additionally, the Chinese Remainder Theorem can only be used when the moduli are relatively prime. This can sometimes be difficult to determine, especially when working with larger numbers. Despite these challenges, the Chinese Remainder Theorem remains a valuable tool for mathematicians and can be used to solve a variety of problems.\nThe theorem has been used in a variety of applications, ranging from number theory to cryptography. However, the Chinese Remainder Theorem was not always so well-known.\nIn fact, it was not until the 19th century that the theorem began to be widely used. This is largely due to the work of Chinese mathematician Sun Tzu, who provided the first complete proof of the theorem. Since then, the Chinese Remainder Theorem has been studied by mathematicians all over the world and has become an essential tool in many different fields.\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem has a wide range of applications, from cryptography to music composition. In cryptography, the theorem is used to design schemes for secret sharing and public-key encryption. In music composition, it can be used to create patterns that are both complex and pleasing to the ear.\nThe theorem can also be used to solve certain number theory problems, such as finding the order of an element in a finite group. In addition, the Chinese Remainder Theorem has applications in computer science, particularly in the area of error-correcting codes. Overall, the Chinese Remainder Theorem is a powerful tool with a wide range of applications.\nToday, the theorem is still an active area of research, with new applications being discovered regularly. As such, it is clear that the Chinese Remainder Theorem has had a significant impact on Mathematics and its development.\nThis book is written for people who want to learn about the Chinese Remainder Theorem. It will cover the basics of the theorem, as well as some more advanced topics. I’ll also share my own experience teaching this theorem to students.\nOne of the most essential subjects in mathematics is number theory. This branch of mathematics deals with the properties and relationships between integers, which are the building blocks of all other numbers. It is a critical tool for solving problems in other areas of mathematics, as well as in physics and engineering.\nDespite its importance, number theory can be challenging for students to grasp. In this book, we will cover the fundamental concepts of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, and provide tips on how to make the material engaging and relevant.\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem is a staple in many high-level mathematics courses for good reason. This theorem has been used for centuries to help mathematicians solve complex problems, and it’s an essential tool for anyone looking to pursue a career in mathematics.

    "text": "4.7 Chinese Remainder Theorem\nWhen solving a linear congruence with a large modulus it is sometimes useful to reduce the linear congruence to a system of linear congruences with smaller moduli. Being able to construct a solution to the original congruence from a linear system of congruence equations is where the Chinese Remainder Theorem is often applied.\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem is also useful of resolving elementary word problems, as such some are given in the exercises at the end of the section.\nNow to see how the Chinese Remainder Theorem works it’s useful to see an example first. Let’s solve the following linear system of congruence equations. \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{crtex}\n\\begin{cases}\nx\\equiv 15 \\pmod{27} \\\\\nx\\equiv 16 \\pmod{20}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\\] Notice, \\(20\\) and \\(27\\) are relatively prime, so we can find integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(20a+27b=1\\).\nIn fact by inspection, we find \\(a=-4\\) and \\(b=3\\) since \\(20(-4)+27(3)=1\\). We claim \\(x=15(20)(-4)+16(27)(3)=96\\) is a solution to both linear congruence equations in \\(\\ref{crtex}\\). More specifically, we will say, \\(x\\equiv 96 \\pmod{540}\\) is solution to the system in \\(\\ref{crtex}\\) where \\(540=(20)(27)\\). This strategy and the uniqueness is justified in the following well-known theorem.\n\nExample 4.15 Solve the linear system of congruences \\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nx\\equiv 5 \\pmod{4} \\\\\nx\\equiv -3 \\pmod{7}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. We find \\(N=(3)(4)(7)=84\\) and we use a table to construct the solution.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}   i & n_i & a_i & \\bar{n}_i & u_i  \\\\   \\hline\n1 & 3 & 2 & 84/3=28 & 28u_1\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\Longrightarrow u_1=1  \\\\   \n2 & 4 & 5 & 84/4=21 & 21u_2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\Longrightarrow  u_2=1  \\\\   \n3 & 7 & -3 & 84/7=12 & 12u_3\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\Longrightarrow  u_3=3  \n\\end{array}\n\\] By \\(\\ref{Chinese Remainder I}\\) the solution to the system is \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{solone}\nx=(2)(28)(1)+(5)(21)(1)+(-3)(12)(3)=53 \\pmod{84}.\n\\end{equation}\\] as wanted.\n\n\nTheorem 4.9 [Chinese Remainder I] Suppose \\(n_1,\\) \\(n_2,\\) …, \\(n_s\\) are pairwise relatively prime positive integers. Then the system of congruences \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{thm:cr2}\n\\begin{cases}\nx\\equiv a_1 \\pmod{n_1} \\\\\nx\\equiv a_2 \\pmod{n_2} \\\\\n\\quad \\vdots \\\\\nx\\equiv a_s \\pmod{n_s} \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{*}\n\\end{equation}\\] has a unique solution modulo \\(N=n_1n_2\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot n_s.\\)\n\n\nProof. Let \\(\\bar{n}_i=N\\left/n_i.\\right.\\) We know that \\(\\left(n_i,\\bar{n}_i\\right)=1\\) for \\(i=1, ... ,s\\) because \\(\\left(n_i,n_j\\right)=1\\) whenever \\(i\\neq j.\\) Therefore, for each \\(i,\\) there are integers \\(v_i\\) and \\(u_i\\) such that \\(v_i n_i+u_i \\bar{n}_i=1;\\) and using these \\(u_i\\) we can construct a solution to the system as \\[\nx=a_1\\bar{n}_1u_1+a_2\\bar{n}_2u_2+\\cdots+a_s\\bar{n}_su_s.\n\\] To verify this is a solution, check the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) congruence equation in \\(\\ref{thm:cr2}\\), namely, \\[\nx=\\sum _{k=1}^s a_k\\bar{n}_ku_k\\equiv a_i\\bar{n}_iu_i\\equiv a_i \\pmod{n_i}\n\\] for \\(1\\leq i\\leq s\\). To prove uniqueness, assume \\(y\\) is a solution to the system of congruences. Then \\(x_0\\equiv a_i\\equiv y \\pmod{n_i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq s\\). Hence, \\(n_i|\\left(x_0-y\\right)\\) for each \\(n_i\\) and since no two of the \\(n_i\\) have a common factor, \\(n_1n_2\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot n_s|\\left(x_0-y\\right),\\) that is \\(N\\left|\\left(x_0-y\\right).\\right.\\) Thus, \\(y\\equiv x_0 \\pmod{N}.\\)\n\n\nExample 4.16 Solve the linear system of congruences.\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx\\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\\\\nx\\equiv 2 \\pmod{6} \\\\\nx\\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. We find \\(N=(5)(6)(7)=210\\) and we use a table to construct the solution.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}   \ni & n_i & a_i & \\bar{n}_i & u_i  \\\\   \\hline\n1 & 5 & 3 & 210/5=42 & 42u_1\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\Longrightarrow u_1=3  \\\\   \n2 & 6 & 2 & 210/6=35 & 35u_2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{6} \\Longrightarrow  u_2=5  \\\\   \n3 & 7 & 4 & 210/7=30 & 30u_3\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\Longrightarrow  u_3=4  \n\\end{array}\\] By \\(\\ref{Chinese Remainder I}\\) the solution is \\[\nx=(3)(42)(3)+(2)(35)(5)+(4)(30)(4)=1208\\equiv 158 \\pmod{210}.\n\\] as desired.\n\n\nExample 4.17 Solve the linear system of congruences.\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nx\\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\\\\nx\\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. We find \\(N=(3)(5)(7)=105\\) and we use a table to construct the solution.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}   \ni & n_i & a_i & \\bar{n}_i & u_i  \\\\   \\hline\n1 & 3 & 2 & 105/3=35 & 35u_1\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\Longrightarrow u_1=2  \\\\   \n2 & 5 & 3 & 105/5=21 & 21u_2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\Longrightarrow  u_2=1  \\\\   \n3 & 7 & 2 & 105/7=15 & 15u_3\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\Longrightarrow  u_3=1  \n\\end{array}\n\\] Therefore, \\[\nx_0=(2)(35)(2)+(3)(21)(1)+(2)(15)(1)=263\\equiv 23 \\pmod{105}.\n\\] is the solution by the \\(\\ref{Chinese Remainder I}\\).\n\n\nExample 4.18 Solve the linear system of congruences.\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\\\\nx\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nx\\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\\\\nx\\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. We find \\(N=(2)(3)(5)(7)=210\\) and we use a table to construct the solution.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}   \ni & n_i & a_i & \\bar{n}_i & u_i  \\\\   \\hline\n1 & 2 & 1 & 210/2=105 & 105u_1\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\Longrightarrow u_1=1  \\\\   \n2 & 3 & 2 & 210/3=70 & 70u_2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\Longrightarrow  u_2=1  \\\\   \n3 & 5 & 3 & 210/5=42 & 42u_3\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\Longrightarrow  u_3=3  \\\\   \n4 & 7 & 4 & 210/7=30 & 30u_4\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\Longrightarrow  u_3=4  \n\\end{array}\n\\] By \\(\\ref{Chinese Remainder I}\\) the solution is \\[\nx_0=(1)(105)(1)+(2)(70)(1)+(3)(42)(3)+(4)(30)(4)=1103\\equiv 53 \\pmod{210}.\n\\] as desired.\n\n\nTheorem 4.10 [Chinese Remainder Theorem II] Suppose \\(n_1, n_2,, \\ldots n_s\\) are pairwise relatively prime positive integers and that \\(\\left(a_i,n_i\\right)=1\\) for each \\(i.\\) Then the system of congruences \\(a_1 x\\equiv b_1 \\pmod{n_1}\\), \\(a_2 x\\equiv b_2 \\pmod{n_2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(a_s x\\equiv b_s \\pmod{n_s}\\) has a unique solution modulo \\(N=n_1n_2\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot n_s.\\)\n\n\nSolution. Since \\(\\left(a_i,n_i\\right)=1\\) for each \\(i,\\) we know that each congruence in the system has a solution, we first choose integers \\(x_1, x_2, ... ,x_s\\) such that \\(a_i x_i\\equiv b_i \\pmod{n_i}.\\) Let \\(\\bar{n}_i=N\\left/n_i\\right.\\) and since no two of the \\(n_i\\) have a common factor, we see that \\(\\left(n_i,\\bar{n}_i\\right)=1.\\) Thus there is integer \\(u_i\\) such that \\(\\bar{n}_iu_i\\equiv 1 \\pmod{n_i}.\\) We now show that the number \\(x_0\\) defined by \\[\nx_0=\\sum _{i=1}^s x_i\\bar{n}_iu_i\n\\] is a solution of the original system of congruences. First note that \\(n_i\\) divides each \\(\\bar{n}_i\\) when \\(j\\neq i.\\) Thus for each \\(i,\\) we have,\n\\[\na_ix_0=\\sum _{k=1}^s a_k x_k \\overline{n}_k u_k\\equiv a_ix_i\\equiv b \\pmod{n_i}.\n\\] Hence, \\(x_0\\) is s solution of each congruence. If \\(y\\) is a solution to the system of congruences, then \\(x_0\\equiv x_i\\equiv y \\pmod{n_i}.\\) Hence, \\(n_i|\\left(x_0-y\\right)\\) for each \\(n_i\\) and since no two of the \\(n_i\\) have a common factor, \\(n_1n_2\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot n_s|\\left(x_0-y\\right),\\) that is \\(N\\left|\\left(x_0-y\\right).\\right.\\) Thus, \\(y\\equiv x_0 \\pmod{N}.\\)\n\n\nExample 4.19 Solve the linear system of congruences.\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n2 x\\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n3x\\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n5 x\\equiv 46 \\pmod{51}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. We find \\(N=(7)(5)(51)=1785\\) and we use a table to construct the solution. \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}   \ni & n_i & a_i & b_i &  a_i x_i \\equiv b_i \\pmod{n_i} & \\bar{n}_i & \\bar{n}_iu_i  \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n_i} \\\\   \\hline\n1 & 7 & 2 & 3 & x_1=5 & 255 & u_1=5  \\\\   \n2 & 5 & 3 & 4 & x_2=3 & 357 &  u_2=3  \\\\   \n3 & 51 & 5 & 46 & x_3=50 & 35 & u_3=35  \n\\end{array}\\] By \\(\\ref{Chinese Remainder II}\\) the solution is \\[\nx_0=(5)(255)(5)+(3)(357)(3)+(50)(35)(35)=70838 \\equiv 1223 \\pmod{1785}.\n\\] as required."

    "section": "5.1 Wilson’s Theorem",
    "text": "5.1 Wilson’s Theorem\nThis theorem is named after one of Edward Waring’s students, John Wilson. But actually, Wilson only observed the result to be true and did not provide its proof. Later Euler proved Wilson’s theorem and then Gauss gave a generalization. Basically, the theorem states that the factorial of a prime number minus one is congruent to minus one modulo the prime. Interestingly, its converse is also well-known and gives a sufficient condition for an integer to be a prime.\nBefore we state and prove Wilson’s theorem let’s Illustrate with \\(p=13.\\)\nFor \\(p=13\\) we have \\((13-1)!\\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}\\) which we can prove by using the \\((13-3)/2\\) congruences\n\\(2\\cdot 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}\\), \\(3\\cdot 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}\\),\n\\(4\\cdot 10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}\\),\n\\(5\\cdot 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}\\), and\n\\(6\\cdot 11 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}\\). When these \\((13-3)/2\\) congruences are multiplied together and the factors are rearranged, we get \\(2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (13-2)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}\\) and thus \\((13-2)!\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13};\\) whence \\((13-1)!\\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}\\).\n\nTheorem 5.1 [Wilson] If \\(p\\) is prime, then \\((p-1)!\\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}.\\)\n\n\nProof. The cases \\(p=2\\) and \\(p=3\\) are evident. Choose any integer \\(a\\) from the list \\(1,2,3, ... ,p-1.\\) Recall that the linear congruence \\(a x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\) has a unique solution \\(x,\\) since \\((a,p)=1.\\) Notice that if \\(a x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\) and \\(a=x\\) then \\(a\\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{p}\\) and so there are exactly \\(\\left(\\frac{p-3}{2}\\right)\\) pairs left. If we omit the numbers \\(1\\) and \\(p-1,\\) the effect is to group the remaining integers \\(2, 3, ... , p-2\\) into pairs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) where \\(a\\neq b,\\) such that their product \\(a b\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}.\\) When these \\((p-3)/2\\) congruences are multiplied together and the factors are rearranged, we get \\(2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (p-2)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\) and thus \\((p-2)!\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p};\\) whence \\((p-1)!\\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}\\) as desired.\n\n\nTheorem 5.2 [Converse of Wilson’s Theorem] If \\(n>2\\) is a positive integer such that \\((n-1)!\\equiv -1 \\pmod{n},\\) then \\(n\\) is prime.\n\n\nProof.

    "text": "5.2 Fermat’s Theorem\nGiven a prime number \\(p\\) and a positive integer \\(a\\), Fermat’s Theorem says that \\(a\\) to the \\(p-1\\) power is congruent to 1 modulo \\(p\\). Fermat’s Theorem takes care of solving linear congruences with prime modulus and provides a formula for finding the solution.\n\nExample 5.1  \nBefore stating and proving Fermat’s Theorem let’s consider the congruence \\(5^{22}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}.\\) To illustrate why this is true, let \\(p=23\\) and \\(a=5\\). Notice that \\(1\\cdot 5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{23}\\) and see \\(\\ref{fttab}\\) for the other congruences.\nConsequently, we have,\n\\[\n\\prod _{k=1}^{22} (k\\cdot 5)=5^{22}22! \\equiv 22! \\pmod{23}\n\\] Whence, \\(5^{22}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\n\nTheorem 5.3 [Fermat] If \\(p\\) is prime and \\(a\\) is a positive integer with \\((a,p)=1,\\) then \\(a^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\)\n\n\nProof. Consider the \\(p-1\\) integers: \\(a, 2a, 3a,\\)…, \\((p-1)a.\\) These integers have the following property: if \\(r a\\equiv s a \\pmod{p}\\) with \\(1\\leq r<s\\leq p-1,\\) then \\(r\\equiv s \\pmod{p}\\) because \\((a,p)=1.\\) Therefore, these integers must be congruent modulo \\(p\\) to \\(1,2,3, ... , p-1\\) taken in some order. Multiplying all of these congruence together yields \\(a^{p-1}(p-1)!\\equiv (p-1)! \\pmod{p}\\) and since \\(((p-1)!,p)=1,\\) we have \\(a^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\) as desired.\n\nIf \\(p\\) is prime and \\(a\\) is a positive integer with \\((a,p)=1,\\) then \\(a^p\\equiv a \\pmod{p}\\) follows as well because \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\) and so \\(a^p\\equiv a \\pmod{p}\\). If \\((a,p)=p\\) then \\(a^p\\equiv a\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\\) and so in either case we have \\(a^p\\equiv a \\pmod{p}\\).\n\nExample 5.2 Use Fermat’s theorem to solve \\(23x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{53}\\).\n\n\nSolution. Since \\(53\\) is prime and \\((23,53)=1\\) we can apply Fermat’s theorem, to find \\(23^{52}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{53}\\). Therefore a solution is \\(x\\equiv 23^{51} \\pmod{53}\\). Using \\(23^{25}\\equiv 23 \\pmod{53}\\), we find the solution to be \\(x\\equiv 23\\cdot 23 \\cdot 23 \\equiv 30 \\pmod{53}\\).\n\n\nExample 5.3 Compute \\(2^{340}\\) modulo \\(341\\). Use this to show that the converse of Fermat’s Theorem is not true.\n\n\nSolution. Since \\(2^{340}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{341}\\), if the converse of Fermat’s Theorem were true then \\(341\\) would be prime. However, \\(341=11\\cdot 13\\) and so the converse of Fermat Little Theorem is not true.\n\n\nExample 5.4 Show that if \\(p\\) is a prime and \\(a\\) is an integer such that \\((a,p)=1,\\) then \\(a^{p-2}\\) is an inverse of \\(a\\) modulo \\(p.\\)\nFind the inverse of \\(5\\) modulo \\(23.\\)\n\n\nSolution. By Fermat’s Theorem we know that \\(a^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\) and so \\(a\\cdot a^{p-2}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}.\\) Therefore, \\(a^{p-2}\\) is an inverse of \\(a\\) modulo \\(p.\\)\nSince \\(5^{22}=5\\cdot 5^{21}\\equiv \\pmod{23}\\) and \\(5^{21}\\equiv 14 \\pmod{23}.\\) We see that \\(5\\cdot 14\\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\) and so \\(14\\) is the inverse of \\(5\\) modulo \\(23.\\)\n\n\nExample 5.5 Show that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers and \\(p\\) is a prime with \\((a,p)=1,\\) then the solutions of the linear congruence \\(a x\\equiv b \\pmod{p}\\) are the integers \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\equiv a^{p-2}b \\pmod{p}.\\)\n\n\nExample 5.6 Solve the two linear congruences \\(4x\\equiv 11 \\pmod{19}\\) and \\(5x\\equiv 19 \\pmod{23}.\\)\n\n\nSolution. Since \\(a^{p-2}\\) is the inverse of \\(a\\) modulo \\(p\\) we have\n\\[\na x\\equiv a\\left(a^{-1}b\\right)=\\left(a a^{p-2}\\right)b=a^{p-1}b\\equiv b \\pmod{p}\n\\] by Fermat’s Theorem.\n\n\nExample 5.7 By Fermat’s Theorem we have \\(4^{18}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}\\) and \\(5^{22}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\); so \\(x\\equiv 4^{17}\\cdot 11\\equiv 17 \\pmod{19}\\) is the solution to \\(4x\\equiv 11 \\pmod{19}\\) and \\(x\\equiv 5^{21}\\cdot 19\\equiv 13 \\pmod{23}\\) is the solution to \\(5x\\equiv 19 \\pmod{23}.\\)\n\n\nExample 5.8 Show \\(p^{q-1}+q^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p q}\\) when \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct primes.\n\n\nSolution. By Fermat’s Theorem we have \\(p^{q-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}\\) and \\(q^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\); thus we consider the system \\(x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\) and \\(x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}.\\) Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem we have,\n\\[\nx\\equiv 1\\left(\\frac{p q}{q}\\right)p^{q-2}+1\\left(\\frac{p q}{p}\\right)q^{q-2}  \\pmod{p q}.\n\\] Finally since \\((p,q)=1\\), we have \\(x\\equiv p^{q-1}+q^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p q}\\) as desired."

The set \\(B=\\{1, 5, 7, 11\\}\\) is a reduced residue system modulo 12 since \\(B\\) contains \\(\\phi(12)=4\\) integers which are all relatively prime with \\(12\\) and no two integers of \\(B\\) are congruent modulo \\(12\\). It is not hard to check that the following sets \\(C\\), \\(D\\), and \\(E\\) are each a reduced residue system modulo 28. \\[\nC=\\{1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27\\}\n\\] \\[\nD=\\{\\pm 1,\\pm 3,\\pm 5,\\pm 9,\\pm 11, \\pm 13\\}\n%\\] \\[\n\\qquad %\\text{and}\\quad\nE=\\{\\pm 5,\\pm 15,\\pm 25,\\pm 45,\\pm 55, \\pm 65\\}\n\\] Notice \\(E\\) was obtain from \\(D\\) by multiplying every integer of \\(D\\) by \\(5\\).\n\nLemma 5.5  If \\[\n\\left\\{\\vlist{r}{{\\phi(m)}}\\right\\}\n\\] is a reduced residue system modulo \\(m\\) and \\((a,m)=1,\\) then \\[\n\\left\\{\\vlist{ar}{{\\phi(m)}}\\right\\}\n\\] is also a reduced residue system modulo \\(m.\\)\n\n\nProof. For \\(\\left\\{\\vlist{ar}{{\\phi(m)}}\\right\\}\\) to be a reduced residue system modulo \\(m\\) we need to show that \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{rrset1}\na r_i\\not \\equiv a r_j\n\\qquad \\text{ for all }\n1\\leq i<j\\leq \\phi (m).\n\\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{rrset2}\n\\left(a r_i,m\\right)=1\n\\qquad \\text{ for all }\n1\\leq i\\leq \\phi (m)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTo prove \\(\\ref{rrset1}\\), assume the contrary, \\(1\\leq i<j\\leq \\phi (m)\\) and \\(a r_i\\equiv a r_j \\pmod{m}\\). Then \\(r_i\\equiv r_j \\pmod{m}\\) because \\((a,m)=1\\). But \\(r_i\\equiv r_j \\pmod{m}\\) can not happen because \\(\\left\\{\\vlist{r}{{\\phi(m)}}\\right\\}\\) is a reduced residue system modulo \\(m\\). Therefore, \\(a r_i\\not \\equiv a r_j \\pmod{m}\\) and so \\(\\ref{rrset1}\\) is proven.\n\nTo show \\(\\ref{rrset2}\\) we suppose \\(1\\leq i\\leq \\phi (m)\\) and that \\(p\\) is a prime divisor of \\(\\left(a r_i,m\\right)\\). Since \\(p|m\\) we can not have \\(p\\left|r_i\\right.\\) because \\(\\left(r_i,m\\right)=1\\). It follows that, \\(\\left(p,r_i\\right)=1\\) and \\(p\\left|a r_i.\\right.\\)\nBy Euclid’s lemma \\(p|a\\). Clearly, \\(p|a\\) and \\(p|m\\) contradict \\((a,m)=1\\). Thus there is no prime divisor of \\(\\left(a r_{i},m\\right)\\) for any \\(1\\leq i\\leq \\phi (m)\\) and so \\(\\ref{rrset2}\\) is proven.\nTherefore, \\(\\left\\{\\vlist{ar}{{\\phi(m)}}\\right\\}\\) is also a reduced residue system modulo \\(m.\\)"

Let \\(\\left\\{\\vlist{r}{{\\phi(m)}}\\right\\}\\) denote the reduced residue system modulo \\(m\\) consisting of positive integers less than \\(m.\\) By \\(\\ref{lemrrs}\\), we know that \\[\n\\left\\{\\vlist{ar}{{\\phi(m)}}\\right\\}\n\\] is also a reduced residue system modulo \\(m.\\) Moreover, the integers \\(\\vlist{r}{{\\phi(m)}}\\) are congruent to the integers \\(\\vlist{ar}{{\\phi(m)}}\\) modulo \\(m\\) in some order. It follows that\n\\[\na^{\\phi (m)}r_1\\cdot  r_2 \\cdots r_{\\phi (m)}\n\\equiv r_1 \\cdot r_2 \\cdots r_{\\phi (m)} \\pmod{m}\n\\] and since \\(\\left(r_1\\cdot r_2 \\cdots r_{\\phi (m)},m\\right)=1\\) we divide by \\(r_1\\cdot r_2\\cdots r_{\\phi (m)}\\) to obtain \\(\\ref{euler}\\).\n\n\nExample 5.13 Prove that the solution to the linear congruence \\(a x\\equiv b \\pmod{m}\\) is \\(x\\equiv a^{\\phi (m)-1}b \\pmod{m}\\) provided \\((a,m)=1.\\)\nThen use Euler’s \\(\\phi\\)-function to solve the linear congruence \\(4 x\\equiv 781 \\pmod{1183}\\).\n\n\nSolution. If \\((a,m)=1,\\) then by Euler’s theorem \\(a^{\\phi (m)}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}\\) and so multiplying by \\(b\\) we have \\[\na^{\\phi (m)}b=a\\left(a^{\\phi  (m)-1}b\\right)\\equiv b \\pmod{m}\n\\] and so \\(x\\equiv a^{\\phi (m)-1}b \\pmod{m}\\) is a solution. By \\(\\ref{lincongchar}\\), this solution is unique.\nTo solve the given linear congruence equation notice \\((4,1183)=1\\), and so by Euler’s theorem, the solution is \\(x \\equiv a^{\\phi (m)-1} b \\pmod{m}\\) where \\(a=4,\\) \\(m=1183,\\) \\(b=781,\\) and \\(\\phi (1183)=936\\). Therefore the unique solution is \\(x\\equiv 4^{935}(781)\\equiv 491 \\pmod{1183}\\).\n\n\nExample 5.14 Find the last digit in the decimal expansion of \\[\nn=2\\cdot(7^{1000})+7\\cdot(3^{99,999}).\n\\]\n\n\nSolution.

Since the sum of integers with last digit of 2 and last digit of 9 is 1, the last digit of \\(2\\left(7^{1000}\\right)+3^{99,999}\\) is 1."

    "text": "6.7 Solving Quadratic Congruences\n\nExample 6.11 Find all solutions to the quadratic congruence equation\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{quadcong}\nf(x)=2x^2+10x+1\\equiv 0 \\pmod{1429530274918301}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n::: {.proof }[Solution] The first step in our method is to find the unique factorization of the modulus namely, \\[\nm=1429530274918301=101^3193^4.\n\\] Now we divide this problem into solving both of the following equations. \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{qc1}\n2x^2+10x+1\\equiv 0 \\pmod{101}\n\\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{qc2}\n2x^2+10x+1\\equiv  0 \\pmod{193}\n\\end{equation}\\] First we solve (\\(\\ref{qc1}\\)) by making the linear change of variables \\(y=4x+10\\) and \\(d=92\\) because solving (\\(\\ref{qc1}\\)) is equivalent to solving \\(y^2\\equiv 92 \\pmod{101}\\) since\n\\[\ny^2-92\n=(4x+10)^2-92\n%=100+80 x+16 x^2-92\n\\equiv 2x^2+10x+1\n\\equiv 0 \\pmod{101}.\n\\] To determine if \\(y^2\\equiv 92 \\pmod{101}\\) is solvable we compute the Legendre symbol \\(\\left(\\frac{92}{101}\\right)\\) by first factoring \\(92=2^223\\) and then we apply the law of quadratic reciprocity to find,\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{92}{101}\\right)\n=\\left(\\frac{2^2}{101}\\right)\\left(\\frac{23}{101}\\right)\n=\\left(\\frac{23}{101}\\right)\n=\\left(\\frac{101}{23}\\right)\n=\\left(\\frac{9}{23}\\right)\n=1.\n\\]\nSo now we use Shank’s algorithm to solve \\(y^2\\equiv 92 \\pmod{101}.\\) First we find \\(101-1=100=2^2(25)\\) and so we set \\(n=2\\) and \\(k=25.\\) With \\(a=92,\\) \\(n=2,\\) and \\(k=25\\) we perform Shanks algorithm and find \\(t\\equiv 92^{13}\\equiv 71 \\pmod{101}\\) and \\(r\\equiv 92^{25}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{101}\\). Therefore, Shank’s algorithm terminates during the first loop and the solutions are \\(y=\\pm 71.\\)\nSo we need to solve\n\\[\n71\\equiv 4x+10\\pmod{101}\n\\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad\n-71\\equiv 4x+10 \\pmod{101}.\n\\] For the first congruence equation we obtain \\(x\\equiv 91 \\pmod{101}\\) and for the second we obtain \\(x\\equiv 5 \\pmod{101}\\). Therefore the two solutions of the quadratic congruence \\(2x^2+10x+1\\equiv 0 \\pmod{101}\\) are \\(x\\equiv 91 \\pmod{101}\\) and \\(x\\equiv 5 \\pmod{101}.\\)\nNext we solve (\\(\\ref{qc2}\\)) by making the linear change of variables \\(y=4x+10\\) and \\(d=92\\) because solving \\(2x^2+10x+1\\equiv 0 \\pmod{193}\\) is equivalent to solving \\(y^2\\equiv 92 \\pmod{193}.\\) To determine if this equation is solvable we compute the Legendre symbol \\(\\left(\\frac{92}{193}\\right)\\) by first factoring \\(92=2^223.\\) Then\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{92}{193}\\right)\n=\\left(\\frac{2^2}{193}\\right)\\left(\\frac{23}{193}\\right)\n=\\left(\\frac{23}{193}\\right)\n=\\left(\\frac{193}{23}\\right)\n=\\left(\\frac{9}{23}\\right)\n=1\n\\] Therefore, \\(y^2\\equiv 92 \\pmod{193}\\) is solvable.\nNow we use Shank’s algorithm to solve \\(y^2\\equiv 92 \\pmod{193}.\\) First we find \\(193-1=192=2^6(3)\\) and so we set \\(n=6\\) and \\(k=3.\\) Next we find a quadratic nonresidue of \\(193\\) namely \\(q=5\\) since \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{193}\\right)=-1.\\)\nNow with \\(a=92,\\) \\(q=5,\\) \\(n=6,\\) and \\(k=3\\) we perform Shank’s algorithm\nLoop 1: We find \\(t=92^2\\equiv 165 \\pmod{193}\\) and \\(r=92^3\\equiv 126 \\pmod{193}\\).

Therefore the two solutions of the quadratic congruence \\(2x^2+10x+1\\equiv 0 \\pmod{193}\\) are \\(x\\equiv 155 \\pmod{193}\\) and \\(x\\equiv 33 \\pmod{193}.\\)\nNext we will use Hensel’s lifting theorem to lift to solutions modulo \\(101^3\\) and \\(193^4.\\) Thus we compute \\(f'(x)=4x+10\\) and we notice that\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& f'(5) \\equiv 30\\neq 0 \\pmod{101}\n& f'(91)\\equiv 71\\neq 0 \\pmod{101}  \\\\     \n& f'(33) \\equiv 142\\neq 0 \\pmod{193}\n& f'(155)\\equiv 51\\neq 0 \\pmod{193}  \n\\end{align*}\\] Since these values of the derivative are nonzero we know each of these four solutions lift (uniquely) up to the necessary powers. To do so we compute the inverses of each, namely, \\[\\begin{align*}\n& 30u_1\\equiv 1 \\pmod{101} \\Rightarrow  u_1=64 &   & 71u_2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{101} \\Rightarrow  u_2=37 \\\\   \n& 142u_3\\equiv 1 \\pmod{193} \\Rightarrow  u_3=140 &   & 51u_4\\equiv 1 \\pmod{193} \\Rightarrow  u_4=53  \n\\end{align*}\\] Now using the inverses we just computed we can lift our 4 solutions as follows. \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|l}   \nk & x_k=x_{k-1}-f\\left(x_{k-1}\\right)64  \\\\    \\hline\n1 & x_1\\equiv 5\\pmod{101^1}  \\\\   \n2 & x_2=5-f(5)*64\\equiv 3742 \\pmod{101^2}  \\\\   \n3 & x_3=3742-f(3742)*64\\equiv 64948 \\pmod{101^3}   \n\\end{array} \\] \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|l}   \nk & x_k=x_{k-1}-f\\left(x_{k-1}\\right)37  \\\\   \\hline\n1 & x_1\\equiv 91 \\pmod{101^1}  \\\\   \n2 & x_2=6454-f(6454)*37\\equiv 6454 \\pmod{101^2}  \\\\   \n3 & x_3=6454-f(6454)*37\\equiv 965348 \\pmod{101^3}   \n\\end{array} \\] \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|l}   \nk & x_k=x_{k-1}-f\\left(x_{k-1}\\right)140  \\\\    \\hline\n1 & x_1\\equiv 33\\pmod{193^1}  \\\\  \n2 & x_2=33-f(33)*140\\equiv 21263 \\pmod{193^2}  \\\\   \n3 & x_3=21263-f(21263)*140\\equiv 6055601 \\pmod{193^3}   \\\\   \n4 & x_4=6055601-f(6055601)*140\\equiv 811229985 \\pmod{193^4}  \n\\end{array} \\] \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|l}   \nk & x_k=x_{k-1}-f\\left(x_{k-1}\\right)53  \\\\    \\hline\n1 & x_1\\equiv 155 \\pmod{193^1}  \\\\   \n2 & x_2=155-f(155)*53\\equiv 15981 \\pmod{193^2}  \\\\   \n3 & x_3=15981-f(15981)*53\\equiv 1133451 \\pmod{193^3}   \\\\   \n4 & x_4=1133451-f(1133451)*53\\equiv 576258011 \\pmod{193^4}  \n\\end{array} \\] To recap, \\(2x^2+10x+1\\equiv 0 \\pmod{101^3}\\) has solutions \\(64948\\) and \\(965348\\) and \\(2x^2+10x+1\\equiv 0 \\pmod{193^4}\\) has solutions \\(811229985\\) and \\(576258011\\).\nFinally, to solve our originally congruence equation we use the Chinese remainder theorem to solve the 4 linear systems:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n(1) \\left\\{  \n\\begin{array}{l}   \nx\\equiv 64948 \\pmod{101^3}  \\\\  \nx\\equiv 811229985 \\pmod{193^4}  \n\\end{array}  \n\\right.  & \\qquad\n(2) \\left\\{  \n\\begin{array}{l}   \nx\\equiv 64948 \\pmod{101^3}  \\\\   \nx\\equiv 576258011 \\pmod{193^4}  \n\\end{array}  \n\\right.  \\\\\n& \\\\\n(3) \\left\\{  \n\\begin{array}{l}   \nx\\equiv 965348 \\pmod{101^3}   \\\\   \nx\\equiv 811229985 \\pmod{193^4}\n\\end{array}  \n\\right. & \\qquad\n(4) \\left\\{  \n\\begin{array}{l}   \nx\\equiv 965348 \\pmod{101^3}   \\\\   \nx\\equiv 576258011 \\pmod{193^4}  \n\\end{array}  \n\\right.\n\\end{array}\n\\] We use the following tables to construct the four solutions. \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}   \ni & n_i & a_i & \\bar{n}_i & u_i  \\\\   \\hline\n1 & 101^3 & 64948 & 193^4 & 193^4u_1\\equiv 1 \\pmod{101^3} \\Longrightarrow  u_1=970433  \\\\   \n2 & 193^4 & 811229985 & 101^3 & 101^3u_2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{193^4} \\Longrightarrow  u_2=80623169  \n\\end{array}\\] So a solution to (1) is \\[\\begin{align*}\nx_1 & = (64948) \\left(193^4\\right) (970433)+ (811229985) \\left(101^3\\right) (80623169) \\\\\n& \\equiv 1193121168121899 \\pmod{m}.\n\\end{align*}\\] \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}   \ni & n_i & a_i & \\bar{n}_i & u_i  \\\\   \\hline\n1 & 101^3 & 64948 & 193^4 & 193^4u_1\\equiv 1 \\pmod{101^3}\n\\Longrightarrow  u_1=970433  \\\\   \n2 & 193^4 & 576258011 & 101^3 & 101^3u_2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{193^4} \\Longrightarrow  u_2=80623169  \n\\end{array}\n\\] So the solution to (2) is \\[\\begin{align*}\nx_2 & =(64948)\\left(193^4\\right)(970433)+(576258011)\\left(101^3\\right)(80623169) \\\\\n& \\equiv 1386887794953578 \\pmod{m}.\n\\end{align*}\\] \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}   \ni & n_i & a_i & \\bar{n}_i & u_i  \\\\   \\hline\n1 & 101^3 & 965348 & 193^4 & 193^4u_1\\equiv 1 \\pmod{101^3} \\Longrightarrow u_1=970433  \\\\   \n2 & 193^4 & 811229985 & 101^3 & 101^3u_2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{193^4} \\Longrightarrow  u_2=80623169  \n\\end{array}\\] So the solution to (3) is \\[\\begin{align*}\nx_3 & =(965348)\\left(193^4\\right)(970433)+(811229985)\\left(101^3\\right)(80623169) \\\\\n& \\equiv 42642479964718 \\pmod{m}.\n\\end{align*}\\] \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}   \ni & n_i & a_i & \\bar{n}_i & u_i  \\\\   \\hline\n1 & 101^3 & 965348 & 193^4 & 193^4u_1\\equiv 1 \\pmod{101^3} \\Longrightarrow  u_1=970433  \\\\   \n2 & 193^4 & 576258011 & 101^3 & 101^3u_2\\equiv 1 \\pmod{193^4} \\Longrightarrow  u_2=80623169  \n\\end{array}\n\\] So the solution to (4) is \\[\\begin{align*}\nx_4 & = (965348) \\left(193^4\\right) (970433) + (576258011) \\left(101^3\\right) (80623169) \\\\\n& \\equiv 236409106796397 \\pmod{m}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTherefore, the four and only four solutions to \\(\\ref{quadcong}\\) are 1193121168121899, 1386887794953578, 42642479964718, and 236409106796397. :::"

For \\(x=2\\) we find that \\(f'(2)=32\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\) and so \\(x=2\\) has unique lifts modulo \\(5^k.\\) We set \\(x_1=2.\\) Then, since \\((2)(3)\\equiv 1\\pmod{5}\\) we have \\(\\overline{f'(2)}=3,\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*}\nx_2 & =2-f(2)(3)=2-(-35)(3)\\equiv 7\\pmod{25} \\\\\nx_3 & =7-f(7)(3)=7-(76832)(3)\\equiv 7 \\pmod{125}.\n\\end{align*}\\] So we have lifted \\(x\\equiv 5 \\pmod{5}\\) to a solution \\(x\\equiv 7 \\pmod{125}\\); that is we have solved \\(f(x)\\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}.\\) Now we consider the case for \\(f(x)\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}.\\) By inspection, we see that the solutions are \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2 \\pm{7}\\). For \\(x=0\\) we find that \\(f'(0)\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}.\\) Thus we check, \\(f(0)=-35\\equiv 7 \\pmod{49}\\) and so \\(x=0\\) does not lift to a solution modulo \\(7^k\\). For \\(x=2\\) we find that \\(f'(2)=32\\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}\\) and so \\(x=2\\) has unique lifts modulo \\(7^k.\\) We set \\(x_1=2.\\) Then, since \\((4)(2)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\\) we have \\(\\overline{f'(2)}=2,\\) and so\n\\[\nx_2=2-f(2)(2)=2-(-35)(2)\\equiv 23 \\pmod{49}.\n\\] So we have lifted \\(x\\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\) to a solution \\(x\\equiv 23 \\pmod{49}\\); that is we have solved \\(f(x)\\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}.\\) It remains to solve the system \\(x\\equiv 7 \\pmod{125}\\), \\(x\\equiv 23 \\pmod{49}\\). This is easy since \\((125,49)=1\\) and we have \\(125(-29)+49(74)=1\\) and so \\(x=125(-29)(23)+49(74)(7)=-57993\\equiv 3257\\pmod{6125}\\) as desired.\n\n\nExample 7.8 Outline how to solve the polynomial congruence equation. \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{pc6}\n-82+12 x-10 x^2+x^3\\equiv 0 \\pmod{33075}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nSolution.
