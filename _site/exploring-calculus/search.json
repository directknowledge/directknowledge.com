In short, limits are essential for understanding calculus. So what are limits? Put simply, limits are a way of describing what happens when a function gets closer and closer to a certain value.\nFor example, if we have a function that is always increasing but never reaches a specific number, we say that the function approaches that number as its limit. This may not seem like a big deal, but limits are actually incredibly important. They allow us to define things like continuity and differentiability, which are essential concepts in calculus. So next time you’re struggling with a calculus problem, remember that it all comes down to limits!"

And continuity is important because, well, the world is continuous (so it seems)! So limits are pretty important.\nThere are a few techniques that can be helpful for finding limits. One is to think about what the function is doing approaching the point in question. Is it getting closer and closer to a certain value? If so, that value is probably the limit. Another technique is to plug in values that are close to the point in question and see what happens. This can be helpful for getting an intuition for how the function behaves near the point in question. And finally, sometimes it can be helpful to use some algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression before taking the limit.\nAs with all things mathematical, practice makes perfect, so don’t be discouraged if limits give you some trouble at first.

    "text": "1.4 Continuous Functions\nLimits are important in calculus because they allow us to determine whether a function is continuous or not. Intuitively, a function is continuous if given any two points within its domain, there exists a smooth curve that connects those points. Limits enable us to test for continuity by seeing if the function’s value approaches the same number as we approach a specific point within the domain.\nIf the function’s value does approach the same number, then we say that the function is continuous at that point. If the function’s value does not approach the same number, then we say that the function is discontinuous at that point. Continuity is important because it allows us to determine how a function will behave as we approach certain values within its domain.\nContinuity describes how a function behaves over a range of values. A function is continuous if it is smooth and uninterrupted over that range. In other words, there are no sudden jumps or discontinuities. Most functions you encounter in everyday life are continuous. For example, the position of a car on a road is continuous - there are no gaps or discontinuities in the car’s position. On the other hand, a function like 1/x is not continuous, because it has a discontinuity at x=0.\nTogether, limits and continuity allow us to understand and predict the behavior of functions at both the micro and macro levels. At the micro level, limits allow us to understand what happens to a function as x approaches a certain value. And at the macro level, continuity allows us to understand how a function behaves over a range of values. These concepts are essential for understanding and manipulating functions in calculus."

    "section": "1.5 Precise Definition of Limit",
    "text": "1.5 Precise Definition of Limit\nThe existence of limits is one of the fundamental properties distinguishing calculus from ordinary algebra and geometry. Limits are basic to differential and integral calculus and play an important role in many other branches of mathematics. They also occur in physics and other sciences in connection with limiting cases and approximations. Informally, limits describe the behavior of a function as its arguments “approach” certain defined values; they provide a precise foundation for calculus, enabling earlier work with limits to be rigorously justified.\nIn most cases limits can be found by algebraic manipulations; more sophisticated means may sometimes be required, but even in difficult cases it is almost always possible to find some numerical indication of the desired limit. Many functions have limits at infinity that can be expressed in simple algebraic form, while others grow so rapidly that no finite limit exists.\nConversely, some functions have limits that do not exist when approached from either direction (the right or left), while others that have left and right limits may not have a limit as x approaches any real number other than these two specific values. The concept of a limit is thus seen to be closely related both to that of continuity (which deals with single-valued functions only) and to that of an infinite series, which enables discontinuities and multivalued functions also to be treated rigorously by means of limits.\nOne might wonder, “Why do we need a precise definition of limits? Can’t we just say that a limit is when a function gets close to a certain value?” While this informal definition suffices in many cases, there are situations where a more precise definition is required. For example, consider the function f(x) = 1/x. As x approaches 0, this function gets closer and closer to infinity. However, it never actually reaches infinity.\nSo if we were to use the informal definition of limits, we would say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 is infinity. However, this is not very useful, since it doesn’t tell us anything about what happens to the function at x = 0. To get around this problem, mathematicians have devised a more precise definition of limits.\nThis definition allows us to say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 is actually undefined. While this might not seem like a very satisfying answer, it does give us important information about the behavior of the function at x = 0. So in some cases, a more precise definition of limits can be quite helpful.\nHowever, the definition of limits is actually quite technical, and it turns out to be very useful in calculus and other areas of mathematics. Without a precise definition of limits, many important theorems would be impossible to prove. So next time you’re feeling frustrated with your math homework, remember that your struggles could be helping to further the field of mathematics!"

If so, then you’ve experienced limits firsthand. Whenever you’re driving, you’re constantly changing speeds, and your car’s speedometer is measuring the rate of change of your car’s velocity.\nBut what happens when your car comes to a stop? The speedometer still measures a nonzero rate of change, but it’s obvious that your car’s velocity has changed dramatically. This is because the speedometer is measuring the instantaneous rate of change, or the limit of the average rate of change as the time interval approaches zero. This may seem like a lot of math jargon, but limits are actually quite intuitive.\nIn essence, they tell us how things are changing at a given moment. And limits are not just useful for calculus; they’re also essential for understanding rates of change in everyday life. So next time you’re stuck in traffic, just think of it as an opportunity to learn about limits!"

With a little practice, anyone can learn to find them. And once you’ve mastered limits, you’ll be well on your way to understanding one of the most important branches of mathematics."

Similarly, continuity is important in many fields, including economics and computer programming. In fact, virtually any time you’re dealing with change or movement, limits and continuity are likely to be involved.\nFor example, limits can be used to understand how a car accelerates or how a projectile moves through the air. Continuity can be used to determine whether a path is smooth or whether a financial market is stable. In each of these cases, limits and continuity provide valuable insight that can help us to make better decisions.\nSo next time you’re stuck in traffic or trying to figure out why your computer keeps crashing, remember that you’re actually dealing with some pretty complex math!"

    "text": "1.9 Summary\nLimits, the cornerstone of calculus, are a measure of how close a function gets to a certain value as it approaches that value from either direction. In other words, limits tell us how a function behaves near a point, such as whether it approaches the point from above or below, or oscillates around the point.\nContinuity is a related concept: it deals with how well a function can be defined at a point, and whether it behaves predictably near that point. A function is continuous at a point if its limit exists at that point and if the function’s value at that point equals the limit. Intuitively, this means that a continuous function can be drawn without lifting one’s pencil from the paper. Many of the most important results in calculus depend on continuity; in fact, one could argue that calculus is really about continuity.\nThe idea of limits is used to define all sorts of important geometric objects such as tangent lines and curves, and these in turn are used to study functions and their behavior. Continuity is also used extensively in physics: for example, when solving problems involving fluids or electricity, one often assumes that the underlying functions are continuous. In short, continuity is a fundamental concept in calculus with far-reaching implications.\nIn the world of mathematics, limits are important because they help to define continuity. In other words, limits tell us when a function is “continuous” or “smooth.” Without limits, it would be difficult to calculate things like derivatives and integrals. So, in a sense, limits are the foundation of calculus. Without them, many of the important ideas in calculus would simply not be possible. Of course, limits can be a bit tricky to understand at first. But once you get the hang of it, you’ll see that they’re not so bad after all. And who knows? You might even come to enjoy working with them."

    "section": "2.1 Limits Using Tables",
    "text": "2.1 Limits Using Tables\nA limit is used to describe the behavior of a function near a point but not at the point. The function need not even be defined at the point. If it is defined there, the value of the function at the point does not affect the limit. Intuitively, \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\lim _{x\\to  c}f(x)=L\n\\end{equation}\\] means we can make\\(f(x)\\) as close to \\(L\\) as we wish by taking any \\(x\\) sufficiently close to, but different from \\(c.\\)\n\nExample 2.1 Find the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\) using a table of functional values for \\[\\begin{equation}\nf(x)=\\frac{4x-9}{x^2-4}\n\\end{equation}\\] and \\(c=3.\\)\n\n\nSolution. We compute, \\[\n\\begin{array}{l|l}\nx & f(x)  \\\\ \\hline\n2.997 & 0.599758 \\\\\n2.998 & 0.599839 \\\\\n2.999 & 0.59992\n\\end{array}\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{array}{l|l}\nx & f(x)  \\\\ \\hline\n3.003 & 0.600238 \\\\\n3.002 & 0.600159 \\\\\n3.001 & 0.600079\n\\end{array}\n\\] Thus as \\(x\\) approaches \\(3\\) from the left we estimate that \\(f(x)\\) approaches \\(3/5\\); and as \\(x\\) approaches \\(3\\) from the right we estimate that \\(f(x)\\) approaches \\(3/5.\\) Therefore, we estimate \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\lim _{x\\to 3}\\frac{4x-9}{x^2-4}=\\frac{3}{5}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nExample 2.2 We will use a guessing method to show why the formal definition of a limit is a necessity.\nUse a table to guess the values of \\[\\begin{equation}\nL=\\lim _{x\\to 0}\\frac{2\\sqrt{x+1}-x-2}{x^2}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nSolution. From the table \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{array}{cccccccc}\nx & -0.5 & -0.1 & -0.01 & -0.001 & 0 & 0.001 & 0.005 \\\\\nf(x) & -0.3431 & -0.2633 & -0.2513 & -0.2501 & \\text{-} & -0.2499 & -0.2494\n\\end{array}\n\\end{equation*}\\] The number \\(L\\) is suggested to be \\(-0.25.\\) Interestingly, if you try \\[\\begin{equation}\nx=0.0000001\n\\end{equation}\\] just to make sure you have taken numbers close enough to 0, you may find that the calculator gives the value 0. Does this mean that the limit is 0? No, the calculator may give you a false answer because when \\(x\\) is small enough (like \\(0.0000001\\) ) then \\(2\\sqrt{x+1}-x-2\\) seems like 0. But in fact \\(f(0.0000001)\\) is not equal to 0.\n\nThe point is, using technology to verify a computation can lead to misunderstanding; and in fact, a formal definition of a limit is needed. Using the formal definition of a limit, we can prove what the value of the limit is without any doubt. This type of proof is usually called an epsilon-delta proof since the formal definition is usually stated with the greek letters $$ (epsilon) and $$ (delta).\n\nExample 2.3 We will use a guessing method to show why the formal definition of a limit is a necessity.\nUse tables of values to find the limit \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\lim _{x\\to 0}\\left(x^3+\\frac{\\cos  5x}{10,000}\\right).\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nSolution. We construct a table of values. \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{array}{cccccc}\nx & 1 & 0.5 & 0.1 & 0.05 & 0.01 \\\\\nf(x) & 1.000028 & 0.124920 & 0.001088 & 0.000222 & 0.000101\n\\end{array}\n\\end{equation*}\\] From the table it appears that \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\lim _{x\\to 0}\\left(x^3+\\frac{\\cos  5x}{10,000}\\right)=0.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nHowever, if we persevere with smaller values of \\(x,\\) the next table suggests \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\lim _{x\\to 0}\\left(x^3+\\frac{\\cos  5x}{10,000}\\right)\n=0.0001000=\\frac{1}{10,0000}\n\\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\nx & 0.005 & 0.001 \\\\\nf(x) & 1.00010009 & 0.00010000\n\\end{array}\n\\end{equation}\\] In fact, \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\lim _{x\\to 0}\\left(x^3+\\frac{\\cos  5x}{10,000}\\right)=\\frac{1}{10,0000}\n\\end{equation}\\] which is easily proven once the formal limit definition is used to prove some interesting limit rules and continuity is discussed.\n\nIn summary, a three-pronged approach to solving limits is often:\n\nnumerical approach by constructing tables of values,\ngraphical approach by sketching a graph by hand or using technology,\nanalytic approach by using algebra or calculus."

    "text": "3.1 Calculating Limits Using Limit Theorems\nIn this topic we concentrate not on the formal definition of a limit of a function of one variable but rather give several examples which emphasis algebra and trigonometry techniques to evaluate limits of functions using basic limit theorems.\n::: {#thm- } [Limit Theorems] For any real number \\(c,\\) suppose the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) both have finite limits at \\(x=c.\\) Then\n\n(Constant) \\(\\lim _{x\\to c} k=k\\) for any constant \\(k\\)\n(Limit of \\(x\\) ) \\(\\lim _{x\\to c} x=c\\)\n(Multiple) \\(\\lim _{x\\to c}k f(x)=k \\lim _{x\\to c}f(x)\\)\n(Sum) \\(\\lim _{x\\to c}[f(x)+g(x)]=\\lim _{x\\to c}f(x)+\\lim _{x\\to c}g(x)\\)\n(Difference) \\(\\lim _{x\\to c}[f(x)-g(x)]=\\lim _{x\\to c}f(x)-\\lim _{x\\to c}g(x)\\)\n(Product) \\(\\lim _{x\\to c}[f(x)g(x)]=\\left( \\lim _{x\\to c}f(x) \\right)\\left( \\lim _{x\\to c}g(x) \\right)\\)\n(Quotient) \\(\\lim _{x\\to c}[f(x)/g(x)]=\\left( \\lim _{x\\to c}f(x) \\right)/\\left( \\lim _{x\\to c}g(x) \\right)\\)\n(Power) \\(\\lim _{x\\to c}[f(x)]^n=\\left( \\lim _{x\\to c}f(x) \\right){}^n\\) where \\(n\\) is a rational number and whenever the limit on the right exists\n(Polynomial) \\(\\lim _{x\\to c}P(x)=P(c)\\) for any polynomial \\(P\\)\n(Rational) \\(\\lim _{x\\to c}R(x)=R(c)\\) for any rational function \\(R\\) where \\(c\\) is in the domain of \\(R.\\) :::\n\n\nExample 3.1 Find the limit of \\(f(x)=\\frac{2x^3-5x+8}{x^2-3}\\) at \\(x=3.\\)\n\n\nSolution. By using several limit rules, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\lim _{x\\to 3}\\frac{2x^3-5x+8}{x^2-3}\n=\\frac{\\lim _{x\\to 3}\\left(2x^3-5x+8\\right)}{\\lim _{x\\to 3}\\left(x^2-3\\right)} \\\\\n& \\qquad =\\frac{\\lim _{x\\to 3}\\left(2x^3\\right)-\\lim _{x\\to 3}(5x)+\\lim _{x\\to 3}(8)}{\\lim _{x\\to 3}\\left(x^2\\right)-\\lim _{x\\to 3}(3)} \\\\\n& \\qquad =\\frac{2 \\lim _{x\\to 3}\\left(x^3\\right)- 5\\lim _{x\\to 3}(x)+8}{\\lim _{x\\to 3}\\left(x^2\\right)-3} \\\\\n& \\qquad =\\frac{2 \\left(\\lim _{x\\to 3} x\\right){}^3- 5(3)+8}{\\left(\\lim _{x\\to 3}x\\right){}^2-3}\n=\\frac{2 (3)^3- 5(3)+8}{(3)^2-3}\n=\\frac{47}{6}\n\\end{align*}\\] Notice this is the same as evaluating the rational function \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x=3\\).\n\n\nExample 3.2 Compute the limit of \\(f(x)=\\frac{2x^3+x^2-16x+12}{x^2-4}\\) at \\(x=2.\\)\n\n\nSolution. By using several limit rules, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\lim _{x\\to 2}\\frac{2x^3+x^2-16x+12}{x^2-4}\n=\\lim _{x\\to 2}\\frac{(x-2)\\left(2x^2+5x-6\\right)}{(x-2)(x+2)} \\\\\n& \\qquad  =\\lim _{x\\to 2}\\frac{\\left(2x^2+5x-6\\right)}{(x+2)}  \n=\\frac{\\left(2(2)^2+5(2)-6\\right)}{((2)+2)}\n=3.\n\\end{align*}\\] In the previous example notice that we used \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{limeq}\n\\lim _{x\\to 2}\\frac{(x-2)\\left(2x^2+5x-6\\right)}{(x-2)(x+2)}=\\lim _{x\\to 2}\\frac{\\left(2x^2+5x-6\\right)}{(x+2)}.\n\\end{equation}\\] Now it is not true that the functions \\[\nf(x)=\\frac{\\left(2x^2+5x-6\\right)}{(x+2)} \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad g(x)=\\frac{\\left(2x^2+5x-6\\right)}{(x+2)}\n\\] are the same function because they have different domains. But the above equality is true because \\(x\\) is approaching 2, and not equal to 2. So the point is,because \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) when \\(x\\neq 2\\) we can indeed say \\(\\eqref{limeq}\\) holds. This is an important part of understanding limits.\n\n\nExample 3.3 Suppose \\(\\lim _{x\\to -2^-}f(x)=2,\\) \\(\\lim _{x\\to -2^+}f(x)=4,\\) \\(\\lim _{x\\to -2^-}g(x)=0,\\) and \\(\\lim _{x\\to -2^+}g(x)=0,\\) find \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim _{x\\to -2}[f(x)+g(x)]\n\\quad\n\\text{and}\n\\quad\n\\lim _{x\\to -2}[f(x)g(x)].\n\\end{equation*}\\]\n\n\nSolution. Since \\[\\lim _{x\\to -2^-}f(x)\\neq \\lim _{x\\to -2^+}f(x)\n\\] we know \\(\\lim _{x\\to -2}f(x)\\) does not exist, but this does not imply anything about \\(\\lim _{x\\to -2}[f(x)+g(x)]\\) nor \\(\\lim _{x\\to -2}[f(x)g(x)].\\)\nTo find these limits we first find the two one-sided limits, \\[\n\\lim _{x\\to -2^-}[f(x)+g(x)]=\\lim _{x\\to -2^-}f(x)+\\lim _{x\\to -2^-}g(x)=2+0=2\n\\] \\[\n\\lim _{x\\to -2^+}[f(x)+g(x)]=\\lim _{x\\to -2^+}f(x)+\\lim _{x\\to -2^+}g(x)=4+0=4\n\\] and since \\[\n\\lim _{x\\to -2^-}[f(x)+g(x)]\\neq \\lim _{x\\to -2^+}[f(x)+g(x)]\n\\] we can now say the two-sided limit \\(\\lim _{x\\to -2}[f(x)+g(x)]\\) does not exist. Similarly, \\[\n\\lim _{x\\to -2^-}[f(x)g(x)]=\\left( \\lim _{x\\to -2^-}f(x) \\right)\\left( \\lim _{x\\to -2^-}g(x)\\right)=2(0)=0\\] \\[\n\\lim _{x\\to -2^+}[f(x)g(x)]=\\left( \\lim _{x\\to -2^+}f(x) \\right)\\left( \\lim _{x\\to -2^+}g(x) \\right)=4(0)=0\n\\] and therefore, \\(\\displaystyle\\lim _{x\\to -2}[f(x)g(x)]=0.\\)"

    "text": "5.3 What is a Tangent Line?\nThe tangent line problem is widely considered to be the instigating idea behind the derivative. Computing the slope of a tangent line was a problem that the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat developed. Picking up on these ideas were Isaac Newton and Gottfried Liebniz , who then developed differential calculus.\nFor a general curve it is not easy to define what is meant by a tangent line; for example a tangent line might mean a line touches the curve only once, but this does not work in all cases. Figure \\(\\ref{fig:tangentlines}\\) shows examples of tangent lines.\nThe important idea to remember is that a tangent line is a local concept, we say the tangent line at a point.\nIn our first example we will calculate a series of functions whose graphs are secant lines to the graph of a given function \\(f\\) and use them to infer an equation of the tangent line at a point.\n\nExample 5.4 Let \\(f(x)=2x^3-2x+2\\). Find an equation of the line that passes through the points \\((1/2,5/4)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) and sketch the graph of both \\(f\\) and the secant line. The equation of the secant line is \\(y= \\frac{3}{2} x+\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nDo the same for the points \\((1/2,5/4)\\) and \\((3/4,43/32)\\). We find an equation of the secant line is \\(y=\\frac{3}{8}x+\\frac{17}{16}\\). We repeat this process several times and display the information in the following table. \\[\n\\begin{array}{l|l|l|l} \\small\n\\Delta  x & (x,f(x)) & (x+\\Delta  x,f(x+\\Delta  x)) & \\text{Equation of secant line} \\\\ \\hline\n0.5 & (0.5,1.25) & (1,2) & y=1.5 x+0.5  \\\\\n0.25 & (0.5,1.25) & (0.75,1.34375)   & y=0.375 x+1.0625 \\\\\n0.125 & (0.5,1.25) & (0.625,1.23828) & y=-0.09375 x+1.29688  \\\\\n0.0625 & (0.5,1.25) & (0.5625,1.23096) &  y=-0.304688 x+1.40234 \\\\\n0.03125 & (0.5,1.25) & (0.53125,1.23737) & y=-0.404297 x+1.45215 \\\\\n0.015625 & (0.5,1.25) & (0.515625,1.24293) & y=-0.452637 x+1.47632\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nFrom this table what would you say is the equation for the tangent line of the function \\(f(x)=2x^3-2x+2\\) at \\((1/2,1/4)\\)? Explain your conclusion. We infer the tangent line is \\(y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe difference quotient \\[\n\\frac{\\Delta  y}{\\Delta  x}=\\frac{f\\left(x_2\\right)-f\\left(x_1\\right)}{x_2-x_1}\n\\] is the average rate of change of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\) over the interval \\(\\left[x_1,x_2\\right]\\) \\(_{}\\) and can be interpreted as the slope of the secant line.

The line \\(x-2y=1\\) has slope \\(m=1/2\\) and we use this with the derivative of \\(y=(x-1)/(x+1)\\) to find the \\(x\\). Since \\(y'=2/(x+1)^2\\) we have \\(1/2=(2/((x+1)^2))\\).

    "section": "5.6 Relative Rate of Change",
    "text": "5.6 Relative Rate of Change\nNext we illustrate the importance of the relative rate of change, as compared to the difference between the absolute rate of change and the average rate of change. The absolute change is not the same as the average rate of change. Namely, the absolute change is just the differences in the values of \\(f\\) at the boundary of the interval \\([x,\\Delta x],\\) namely \\(f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x);\\) whereas the average rate of change is the absolute change divided by the size of the interval: \\[\n\\frac{f(x+\\Delta  x)-f(x)}{\\Delta  x}.\n\\] The average rate of change is sometimes more useful; for example, suppose you want to know how long it takes to make some money and not just the size of the money made (absolute change). Knowing the rate at which the money is being made, (the average rate of change over a given time interval) is often useful.\n\nExample 5.10 Temperature readings \\(T\\) (in degrees Celsius) were recorded every hour starting at midnight on a day in April. The time \\(x\\) is measured in hours from midnight. \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccccccccccc}\nx (h) & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\ \\hline\nT (C) & 6.5 & 6.1 & 5.6 & 4.9 & 4.2 & 4.0 & 4.0 & 4.8 & 6.1 & 8.3 & 10.0 & 12.1 & 14.3\n\\end{array}\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccccccccc}\nx (h) & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 21 & 22 & 23 & 24 \\\\ \\hline\nT (C) & 16.0 & 17.3 & 18.2 & 18.8 & 17.6 & 16.0 & 14.1 & 11.5 & 10.2 & 9.0 & 7.9 & 7.0\n\\end{array}\n\\]   - Find the average rates of change of temperatures with respect to time from noon to 3:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. - Estimate the instantaneous rate of change at noon.\n\n\nSolution. The average rates of change are, respectively, \\[\n\\frac{\\Delta  T}{\\Delta  x}=\\frac{T(15)-T(12)}{3}=\\frac{18.2-14.3}{3}=1.3 \\, C/h\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{\\Delta  T}{\\Delta  x}=\\frac{T(14)-T(12)}{2}=\\frac{17.3-14.3}{2}=1.5 \\, C/H\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{\\Delta  T}{\\Delta  x}=\\frac{T(13)-T(12)}{1}=\\frac{16.0-14.3}{1}=1.7 \\, C/h\n\\] We plot the given data and use them to sketch a smooth curve that approximates the graph of the temperature function. Then we draw that tangent line at the point \\(P\\) where \\(x=12\\) and after measuring the sides of the triangle we estimate that the slope of the tangent line is \\[\n\\frac{18.3-8}{14-8.5}=\\frac{10.3}{5.5}\\approx 1.9\n\\] and so the instantaneous rate of change of temperature with respect to time at noon is about \\(1.9 C/h.\\)\n\nSometimes we are not interested in the instantaneous rate of change and instead we may want a relative rate of change (percentage). For example suppose a student makes a 39 on a test, this would be a very good grade if the score is out of 40 points. However if the score was out of a total of 100 points then the grade is not so good.\n\nDefinition 5.2 Let \\(y=f(x),\\) then the relative rate of change at \\(x=x_0\\) is the ratio \\[\n\\frac{f'\\left(x_0\\right)}{f\\left(x_0\\right)}.\n\\]\n\n\nExample 5.11 Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}.\\)\nFind the relative rate of change at \\(x=5\\) and \\(x=75.\\)\n\n\nSolution. Since \\(f'(x)=\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{x}}.\\)\nThe relative rate of change of \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\[\n\\frac{f'(5)}{f(5)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{5}}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{1}{10} \\approx 0.1 \\text{ or } 10\\%.\n\\] The relative rate of change of \\(f\\) at \\(x=75\\) is \\[\n\\frac{f'(75)}{f(75)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{75}}}{\\sqrt{75}} =\\frac{1}{150} \\approx 0.00666667 \\text{ or } 0.6\\%.\n\\]\n\nOften we are more interested in the relative rate of change of a quantity instead of the instantaneous rate of change. If instance, if you are earning \\(25,000/\\text{yr}\\) and receive a 5,000 raise, you would probably be very please. However, if you were making \\(100,000/\\text{yr}\\) you may not be as please since the relative change is not as much. With the \\(100,000/\\text{yr}\\) pay you only have a \\(5,000/100,000=0.05=5\\%\\) increase whereas with the \\(25,000/\\text{yr}\\) pay you have a better percentage increase of \\(5,000/25,000=0.20=20\\%.\\)\n\nExample 5.12 Let \\(f(x)=2x^2-3x+5.\\)\n  - Find the average rate of change from \\(x=2\\) to \\(x=4.\\)\n- Find the instantaneous rate of change at \\(x=2.\\)\n- Find the relative rate of change of \\(f\\) at \\(x=2\\)\n\n\nSolution. The average rate of change of \\(f\\) from \\(x=2\\) to \\(x=4\\) is given by, \\[\n\\frac{f(x+\\Delta  x)-f(x)}{\\Delta  x}\n=\\frac{\\left(2(4)^2-3(4)+5\\right)-\\left(2(2)^2-3(2)+5\\right)}{2}\n=9\n\\] Since \\(f'(x)=4x-3,\\) the instantaneous rate for change of \\(f\\) at \\(x=2\\) is given by, \\(f'(2)=4(2)-3\\) \\(=5.\\) The relative rate of change of \\(f\\) at \\(x=2\\) is \\[\n\\frac{f'(2)}{f(2)}=\\frac{5}{2(2)^2-3(2)+5} =\\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.714286  \\text{ or } 71.\n\\]"

Thanks for the differentiation!\nThe power rule is one of the most basic rules of differentiation. The rule states that if \\(y = x^n\\), then \\(dy/dx = n x^(n-1)\\). In other words, the derivative of a function raised to a power is equal to the power multiplied by the original function raised to one less than the power.\nThis rule can be applied to any number of powers, including negative and fractional powers.

No doubt, differentiation is one of the most important concepts in calculus. And the derivatives of trigonometric functions are an essential part of that. After all, what would calculus be without sine, cosine, and tangent?\nDifferentiation allows us to find rates of change, and the derivatives of trigonometric functions give us a way to find those rates of change for angles. In other words, they help us to figure out how fast something is moving when we only have angles to go on. So the next time you’re trying to find the derivative of some function or other, don’t forget the good old trigonometric functions. They just might be the key to success."

For example, let’s say you have a function \\(f(x)\\) that is equal to \\(g(h(x))\\). To find the derivative of \\(f(x)\\), you would first take the derivative of \\(g(h(x))\\) with respect to \\(h(x)\\), and then multiply that by the derivative of \\(h(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\).\nIn other words, the chain rule tells us that we can ``chain” together the derivatives of the individual functions to get the derivative of the overall function. The chain rule is a powerful tool that can be used to differentiate all kinds of complicated functions. So next time you’re feeling differentiation, just remember: the chain rule is your friend!"

The derivative of this equation with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(2x+2y(dy/dx)=0\\). This derivative can be used to solve for \\(dy/dx\\), which can then be used to find the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\nWhile implicit differentiation may seem like a daunting task, it is a useful tool that can be used to solve problems that would otherwise be unsolvable.

In other words, it allows us to calculate how a function changes as we vary one of its inputs. One of the most useful applications of differentiation is inverse functions.\nRecall that an inverse function is a function that undoes another function; for example, the inverse of the function \\(f(x)=2x\\) is the function \\(g(x)=(1/2)x\\).\nDifferentiating an inverse function is a relatively simple process; all we need to do is apply the chain rule. In general, if we have a function and its inverse, then the derivative of the inverse function is given by a simple formula. So differentiation can be a powerful tool for helping us understand inverse functions and their properties."

The rate of change of its height (in meters per second) will be related to the rate of change of its velocity (in meters per second). We can use differentiation to calculate the rate of change of the height in relation to the velocity.\nIf we know the height and velocity at a particular instant, we can then use calculus to find out how these quantities change over time. This information can be used to predict the behavior of the system. Related rates problems can be challenging, but they are also interesting and enjoyable to solve.

Differentiation involves working with equations and solving for variables, so being comfortable with algebra is essential. Next, start with the basics of differentiation and work your way up to more complex concepts. And finally, don’t be afraid to use visual aids. Drawing graphs and charts can be helpful when trying to understand how differentiation works. By following these tips, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a calculus master!\nWhen it comes to teaching calculus, there’s no one ``right” way. However, there are some differentiation techniques that are more effective than others.

    "text": "8.1 Linearity\nComputing the limit of the difference quotient can be tedious and require ingenuity; fortunately for a large number of common functions there is a better way to compute the derivative. In this section, we detail the power rule, product rule and the quotient rule for differentiation. These rules greatly simplify the task of differentiation. We also give examples on how to find the tangent line give some geometric information; and to find the horizontal tangent lines to the graph of a given function.\nThe next theorem states the common procedural rules for taking derivatives. For example, the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of the derivative functions. The same is not true for a product of functions. To convince yourself that the derivative of the product of two functions is not the product of the derivative functions try an example, say \\(f(x)=x^2\\) and \\(g(x)=x^3.\\)\n::: {#thm- } [Differentiation Rules] Let \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) be functions.\n\n(Constant Rule) If \\(f\\) is a constant function, \\(f(x)=c\\) for some real number \\(c,\\) then \\(f'(x)=0.\\)\n(Power Rule) If \\(f\\) is a power function, \\(f(x)=x^n\\) for some real number \\(n\\), then \\(f(x)=n x^{n-1}.\\)\n(Sum Rule) If \\(f=g+h\\) for any differentiable functions \\(g\\) and \\(h,\\) then \\(f'=g'+h'.\\)\n(Difference Rule) If \\(f=g-h\\) for any differentiable functions \\(g\\) and \\(h,\\) then \\(f'=g'-h'.\\)\n(Linearity Rule) If \\(f=a g+b h\\) for any differentiable functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\), and any two constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then \\(f'=a g'+b h'.\\) :::\n\n\nExample 8.1 Find the derivative of the function \\(f(x)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3.\\)\n\n\nSolution.

Thus the ball will hit the ground 10 seconds after it is thrown upwards.\nThe velocity of the ball at time \\(t\\) is given by the first derivative of \\(s\\), namely \\[\nv(t)=s'(t)=g t+v_0.\n\\] When \\(t=10\\) we find, \\(v(10)=-32 (10)+160=-160\\) and so the velocity of the ball is \\(-160 \\text{ ft}/s\\) when it hits the ground.\nThe ball reaches it’s maximum height when the velocity is zero, thus we solve \\[\nv(t)= g t+v_0=-32 t+160=0\n\\] yielding \\(t=2\\). Its position at \\(t=2\\) is the maximum height which is \\(s(2)=16(2)(-2+10)=256\\). Therefore, 2 seconds after the ball is thrown, the ball reaches it’s maximum height of 256 ft.\n\n\n\nDefinition 10.1 An object that moves along a straight line with position \\(s(t)\\) has velocity \\(v(t)=\\frac{ds}{dt}\\). \\[\na(t)=\\frac{dv}{dt}=\\frac{d^2 s}{dt ^2}\n\\] when these derivatives exist. The speed of an object at time \\(t\\) is \\(|v(t)|.\\)\n\n\nExample 10.3 A particle moving along the \\(x\\)-axis has position \\[\nx(t)=2t^3+3t^2-36t+40\n\\] after an elapsed time of \\(t\\) seconds.\n  - Find the velocity of the particle at time \\(t.\\) - Find the acceleration at time \\(t.\\) - What is the total distance travelled by the particle during the first 3 seconds?\n\n\nSolution. The velocity is given by \\(v(t)=x'(t)=6t^2+6 t-36.\\)\nThe acceleration is given by \\(a(t)=v'(t)=x''(t)=12 t+6.\\)\nSince \\(v(t)=0\\) when\n\\[\n6t^2+6t-36=6(t-2)(t+3)=0\n\\] so \\(t=2, -3\\) but \\(-3\\) is not on \\([0,3]\\). Therefore, the distance covered is \\[\n|x(2)-x(0)|+|x(3)-x(2)|=|-4-40|+|13-(-4)|=61.\n\\]"

    "text": "12.1 The Chain Rule and Its Proof\nWith a lot of work, we can sometimes find derivatives without using the chain rule either by expanding a polynomial, by using another differentiation rule, or maybe by using a trigonometric identity. The derivative would be the same in either approach; however, the chain rule allows us to find derivatives that would otherwise be very difficult to handle. This section gives plenty of examples of the use of the chain rule as well as an easily understandable proof of the chain rule.\n::: {#thm- } [Chain Rule] Suppose \\(f\\) is a differentiable function of \\(u\\) which is a differentiable function of \\(x.\\) Then \\(f(u(x))\\) is a differentiable function of \\(x\\) and \\[\n\\frac{d f}{d x}=\\frac{df}{du}\\frac{du}{dx}.\n\\] :::\n\nProof.

    "text": "13.1 Implicit Differentiation as a Procedure\nIn this section the procedure of implicit differentiation is outlined and many examples are given. Proofs of the derivative formulas for the inverse trigonometric functions are provided and several examples of using them are given. Also detailed is the logarithmic differentiation procedure which can simplify the process of taking derivatives of equations involving products and quotients. Finding the slope of a tangent line is a local process; for example, a circle locally around a point, can have a tangent line even though it is not a function. In fact, every circle has a tangent line at every point.\nThe following process allows us to find derivatives of more general curves (not just functions); and in particular for an implicitly defined function. Notice that the process relies heavily on the chain rule.\n::: {#thm- } [Implicit Differentiation] implicit differentiation Suppose that \\(f(x,y)=0\\) is a given equation involving both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\); and that \\(\\frac{dy}{d x}\\) exists at \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right).\\) Then \\(\\frac{dy}{d x}|_{\\left(x_0,y_0\\right)}\\) can be found using the following procedure:\n\nUsing the chain rule where appropriate, differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \\(x.\\)\nIf possible, solve the differentiated equation algebraically for \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) and evaluate at \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right).\\) :::\n\n\nExample 13.1 Use implicit differentiation to find \\(\\frac{dy}{d x}\\) given \\[\n\\sin (x+y)=y^2 \\cos  x.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. We will use implicit differentiation, and in doing so we use the chain rule on the right hand and the product rule together with the chain rule on the left hand side of the equation: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\cos (x+y)\\frac{d}{dx}(x+y) & =2 y \\cos  x \\frac{dy}{dx}-y^2\\sin  x \\\\\n\\cos (x+y)\\left(1+\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)-2 y \\cos  x \\frac{dy}{dx}& =-y^2\\sin  x\\\\\n\\cos (x+y)+\\frac{dy}{dx}\\cos (x+y)-2 y \\cos  x \\frac{dy}{dx}& =-y^2\\sin  x\\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dx}(\\cos (x+y)-2 y \\cos  x)& =-y^2\\sin  x-\\cos (x+y)\\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dx}& =-\\frac{y^2\\sin  x+\\cos (x+y)}{\\cos (x+y)-2 y \\cos  x}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nExample 13.2 Use implicit differentiation to find the tangent to the folium of Descartes \\(x^3+y^3=6x y\\) at \\((3,3)\\).\n\n\nSolution.

Notice that the graph of \\(f\\) passes the horizontal line test, which implies that \\(f\\) is a one-to-one function and thus must have an inverse function. To find the inverse function of \\(f\\), set \\(y=f(x)\\). Then simply switch the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and solve for \\(y\\). The resulting equation will be a rule for the function \\(f^{-1}\\). To see this, let \\(y=\\frac{2x-3}{7-5x}\\) and then switching the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\): \\(x=\\frac{2y-3}{7-5y}\\). Solving for \\(y\\) yields: \\(y=\\frac{3+7x}{2+5x}\\). Thus, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{3+7x}{2+5x}\\).

    "text": "15.1 General vs Specific Situation\nEvery related rates problem has a general situation (properties that hold true at every instant in time) and a specific situation (properties that hold true at a particular instant in time). Distinguishing between these two situations is often the key to successfully solving a related-rates problem. Here are a few guidelines for solving related rate problems:\n\nRead the problem carefully and identify all given quantities and unknown quantities to be determined.\nIntroduce notation, make a sketch, and label the quantities.\n\nWrite equations involving the variables whose rates of change either are given or are to be determined.\n\nUse implicit differentiation, by differentiating both sides with respect to he appropriate variable.\n\nSubstitute known variables and known rates of change into the resulting equation to determine the missing rate of change.\n\n\nExample 15.3 Model a water tank by a cone 40 ft high with a circular base of radius 20 ft at the top. Water is flowing into the tank at a constant rate of \\(80 \\left.\\text{ft}^3\\right/\\min .\\) How fast is the water level rising when the water is 12 feet deep?\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(x\\) be the radius of the top circle of the body of water and \\(y\\) its height. The radius of the top circle is 20, the height of the cone is 40 ft. By similar triangles, \\(20/40=x/y\\) and so \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}y.\\) The volume of the body of water is \\[\nV=\\frac{1}{3}\\pi  x^2y =\\frac{1}{12}\\pi  y^3.\n\\] Then \\[\n\\frac{d V}{d t}=\\frac{1}{4}\\pi  y^2 \\frac{d y}{d t}.\n\\] When \\(y=12,\\) \\(x=6,\\) and \\(\\frac{d V}{d t}=80,\\) we have \\[80=\\frac{1}{4}\\pi (12)^2 \\frac{d y}{d t}\\] and thus \\[\n\\frac{d y}{d t}=\\frac{80(4)}{\\pi (144)} \\text{ft.}/\\min = \\frac{20}{9 \\pi } \\text{ft.}/\\min  \\approx 0.71 \\text{ft.}/\\min .\n\\]\n\n\nExample 15.4 Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon at a rate of 4.5 cubic feet per minute. Find the rate of change of the radius when the radius is 2 feet.\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(V\\) be the volume of the balloon and let \\(r\\) be the radius. Because the volume is increasing at a rate of 4.5 cubic feet per minute, we know that at time \\(t\\) the rate of change of the volume is \\(\\frac{d V}{d t}=\\frac{9}{2}.\\) The equation that relates the radius \\(r\\) to the volume \\(V\\) is \\(V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3.\\) So we have \\[\n\\frac{d V}{d t}=4\\pi  r^2\\frac{d r}{d t}\n\\] and by solving for \\(\\frac{d r}{dt}\\) we have \\[\n\\frac{d r}{d t}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi  r^2}\\left(\\frac{d V}{d t}\\right).\n\\] Finally, when \\(r=2,\\) the rate of change of the radius is \\[\n\\frac{d r}{d t}=\\frac{1}{16 \\pi }\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) \\approx 0.09\n\\] foot per minute.\n\n\nExample 15.5 A pebble is dropped into a calm pond, causing ripples in the form of concentric circles. The radius of the outer ripple is increasing at a constant rate of 1 foot per second. When the radius is 4 feet, at what rate is the total area \\(A\\) of the disturbed water changing?\n\n\nSolution. For the area of a circle we use \\(A=\\pi r^2\\) and we differentiate implicitly with respect to time \\(t\\) leading to \\[\n\\frac{d A}{d t}=2\\pi  r \\frac{d r}{d t}\n\\] by using the chain rule. Since \\(\\frac{d r}{d t}=1\\) and when \\(r=4\\) we have \\[\n\\frac{d A}{d t}=2\\pi (4)(1) =8 \\pi.\n\\]\n\n\nExample 15.6 A ladder 10 ft long rests against a vertical wall. If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 1 ft/s, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 ft from the wall?\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(x\\) meters be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall and \\(y\\) meters the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are functions of time and \\(\\frac{d x}{d t}\\)= 1 ft/s we are asked to find \\(\\frac{d y}{d t}\\) when \\(x=6\\) ft. The relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is the Pythagorean Theorem, namely \\(x^2+y^2=100.\\) Using implicit differentiation and the chain rule we have \\[\n2 x \\frac{d x}{d t}+2 y \\frac{d y}{d t}=0.\n\\] By solving for \\(\\frac{d y}{d t}\\) we have \\[\n\\frac{d y}{d t}=-\\frac{x}{y}\\frac{d x}{d t}.\n\\] When \\(x=6\\) then $y=8 $, \\[\n\\frac{d y}{ d t}=\\frac{-6}{8}(1) =\\frac{-3}{4} \\text{ ft/s.}\n\\]\n\n\nExample 15.7 Car A is going west at 50 mi/h and car B is going north at 60 mi/h. Both are headed for the intersection of the two roads. At what rate are the cars approaching each other when car A is \\(0.3\\) mi and car B is \\(0.4\\) mi from the intersection?\n\n\nSolution. At a given time \\(t,\\) let \\(x\\) be the distance from car \\(A\\) to the point of intersection \\(P\\) and let \\(y\\) be the distance from car B to \\(P\\) and let \\(z\\) be the distance between the cars, where \\(x,\\) \\(y,\\) and \\(z\\) are measured in miles. Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are decreasing we take the derivatives to be negative and so we are given \\[\n\\frac{d x}{d t}=-50 \\text{ mi/h}\n\\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad\n\\frac{d y}{d t}=-60 \\text{ mi/h}.\n\\] To find \\(\\frac{d z}{d t}\\) we use the Pythagorean Theorem, namely \\(x^2+y^2=z^2\\) and differentiate with respect to time \\(t\\). We have \\[\n2 z \\frac{d z}{d t}=2 x\\frac{d x}{d t}+2 y\\frac{d y}{d t}\n\\] and by solving for \\(\\frac{d z}{d t}\\) we have \\[\n\\frac{d z}{d t}=\\frac{1}{z}\\left(x\\frac{d x}{d t}+ y\\frac{d y}{d t}\\right).\n\\] Now when \\(x=0.3\\) mi and \\(y=0.4\\) mi we have \\(z=0.5\\) mi and so\n\\[\n\\frac{d z}{d t}=\\frac{1}{0.5}[0.3(-50)+0.4(-60)]=-78 \\text{ mi/h}.\n\\] Therefore, the cars are approaching each other at a rate of 78 mi/h.\n\n\nExample 15.8 A person 6 ft tall walks away from a streetlight at the rate of 5 ft/s. If the light is 18 ft above ground level, how fast is the person’s shadow lengthening?\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(x\\) be the length of the shadow and \\(y\\) be the distance of the person from the street light. Using similar triangles, \\(x/6=(x+y)/18\\) and by solving for \\(y\\) we have \\(y=2x.\\) Thus, \\(d y/d t=2 (d x/ d t)\\) and given that \\(d y/ d t=5 \\text{ft}/s\\) we find that \\(d x/ d t=2.5 \\text{ft}/s\\) is the rate the shadow is lengthening.\n\n\nExample 15.9 At noon, a ship sails due north from a point \\(P\\) at 8 knots. Another ship, sailing at 12 knots, leaves the same point 1 h later on a course \\(60{}^{\\circ}\\) east of north. How fast is the distance between the ships increasing at 5 P.M.?\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(A\\) be the distance travelled by the first ship, and \\(B\\) for the distance travelled by the second ship, \\(D\\) for the distance between them, and \\(\\theta\\) the constant angle of \\(60{}^{\\circ}.\\) We need to find \\(\\frac{d D}{d t}\\) at \\(t=5.\\) The equation that relates all the variables is the law of cosines and is \\(D^2=A^2+B^2-2 A B \\cos \\text{  }60{}^{\\circ}.\\)\nUsing the chain rule and implicit differentiation we have\n\\[\n2 D \\frac{d D}{d t}=2 A \\frac{d A}{d t}+ 2B \\frac{d B}{d t}-2\\left(A \\frac{d B}{d t}+B \\frac{d A}{d t}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n\\] since \\(\\cos 60{}^{\\circ}=\\frac{1}{2}\\). Then at \\(t=5,\\) \\(A=5(8)\\) \\(=\\text{40,}\\) \\(B=12(4)\\) \\(=\\text{48,}\\) \\(\\frac{d A}{d t}=8,\\) \\(\\frac{d B}{ d t}=12,\\) and \\[\nD=\\sqrt{40^2+48^2-2(40)(48)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}=\\sqrt{1984}.\n\\] So we have,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d D}{d t}\n& =\\frac{2 (40) (8)+ 2(48) (12)-(40) (12)-(48)(8)}{2 \\sqrt{1984}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{58}{\\sqrt{31}}  \\text{ knots} \\approx 10.4171 \\text{ knots}.\n\\end{align*}\\]"

Extreme values can tell us things like the highest and lowest points on a graph, or the fastest and slowest points in a motion. To find extreme values, we need to take the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero. This will give us the points where the function is either increasing or decreasing at its fastest rate.\nApplications of Differentiation include finding extreme values of a function. The derivative of a function at a point measures the rate of change of the function at that point. So, the derivative can be used to find points where the function is increasing or decreasing at its fastest. These points are known as local extrema, and they can be found by setting the derivative equal to zero and solving. Differentiation can also be used to find points where the function changes from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa). These points are called inflection points, and they can be found by setting the second derivative equal to zero and solving. In addition, differentiation can be used to find absolute extrema, which are the largest and smallest values that a function can take on over a given domain. To find absolute extrema, we need to take into account both the function’s values and its derivatives. So, applications of differentiation are not just limited to finding extreme values; they also allow us to understand the behavior of a function at different points."

This theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval, then there exists at least one point in the interval where the function’s derivative is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval. In other words, if we take any two points in an interval and find the average rate of change of the function between those points, there will be at least one point in the interval where the function’s derivative is equal to that average rate of change. This theorem has a number of important implications, and we’ll discuss some of them in this chapter.\nThe Mean Value Theorem is one of the most important results in calculus. And it’s not just because it’s on the AP Calculus exam. The theorem has countless applications in mathematics, science, and engineering. In fact, it’s often referred to as the “workhorse” of calculus. Differentiation is all about finding rates of change. The Mean Value Theorem tells us that for any function that is continuous on an interval, there exists a point where the rate of change is equal to the average rate of change over the entire interval. In other words, the theorem provides a way to find the “average” rate of change. Of course, the theorem is much more than just a simple averaging result. It has profound implications for how we understand and work with functions. In particular, it gives us a way to estimate values and understand relationships between different quantities.

    "text": "18.3 Monotonic Functions\nA function is monotonic if it either always increases or always decreases as we move from left to right on the graph. In other words, a function is monotonic if its derivative is either always positive or always negative. To see why this is true, recall that the derivative at a point measures the rate of change of the function at that point. So, if the derivative is always positive, then the function is always increasing; if the derivative is always negative, then the function is always decreasing. It’s easy to see that a constant function has a derivative of zero, so it is neither increasing nor decreasing.\nThere are two types of monotonic functions: Increasing functions are those whose values always get larger as we move from left to right. Decreasing functions are those whose values always get smaller as we move from left to right. It’s important to note that a function can be increasing or decreasing without being continuous. In fact, many discontinuous functions are monotonic.\nApplications of Differentiation can be broadly classified into two categories: Monotonic Functions and Non-monotonic Functions. A function is said to be monotonic if it either always increases or always decreases as we move along the x-axis. On the other hand, a function is non-monotonic if it changes direction at least once. Examples of monotonic functions include linear functions and exponential functions. On the other hand, examples of non-monotonic functions include polynomial functions and trigonometric functions. Applications of differentiation to monotonic functions are typically concerned with finding the maximum or minimum values of the function, while applications to non-monotonic functions are typically concerned with finding points of inflection.\nIn our approach, we will dicuss functions that are monotonic with repsect to an interval. In this approach, we see the full power of the derivative."

Similarly, we say that a function is concave down on an interval if it lies entirely below its tangent lines on that interval. The points at which a function changes from concave up to concave down (or vice versa) are called inflection points.\nGeometrically, concavity corresponds to the second derivative. More precisely, we say that a function is concave up on an interval if its second derivative is positive on that interval, and we say that a function is concave down on an interval if its second derivative is negative on that interval. In other words, the second derivative can be used to determine concavity. This is not too surprising, since the second derivative measures the rate of change of the first derivative. So, if the first derivative is increasing, then the function is concave up; if the first derivative is decreasing, then the function is concave down.\nApplications of Differentiation aren’t just limited to finding the slope of a tangent line at a point. In fact, one of the more interesting applications is finding what’s known as an inflection point. An inflection point is a point on a curve where the curve changes from concave up to concave down, or vice versa. To find one, we take the second derivative of a function and set it equal to zero. The second derivative can tell us concavity, so if we set it equal to zero, we’re saying that the concavity changes at that point. And that’s an inflection point! Now that we know how to find them, what are they good for? Well, they’re often used in optimization problems. If we’re trying to maximize or minimize an object’s volume, for example, we might want to know where its inflection points are. That way, we can be sure that we’re not accidentally making the object too big or too small. So next time you see an inflection point, don’t just ignore it - it could be just what you need!"

Differentiation is a process of finding the rate of change of a function, and it turns out that this rate of change can be used to sketch the shape of a graph. For example, if a function is increasing at a constant rate, then its graph will be a straight line. If the rate of change is increasing, then the graph will be curved upwards; if the rate of change is decreasing, then the curve will bend downwards. By understanding how differentiation works, we can gain insight into the shape of many mathematical functions.\nDifferentiation is one of the most powerful tools in mathematics, with applications in everything from physics to engineering. It can also be used to sketch the graphs of functions, a process known as curve sketching. By studying the derivatives of a function, we can learn about its local behavior and how it changes over time. This information can then be used to sketch a rough graph of the function, without having to calculate any points. Curve sketching is a valuable tool for visualizing functions and understanding their behavior. It can also be used to estimate things like turning points and asymptotes, which can be difficult to calculate exactly. In short, curve sketching is a powerful tool that everyone should know how to do."

But what’s even better than solving those kinds of problems is finding applications for them in the real world. And that’s exactly what applied optimization is all about. By understanding the principles of differentiation, we can figure out how to optimize all sorts of things in the world around us. For example, we can use optimization to find the fastest route between two points, or the least expensive way to produce a product. We can even use it to help design more efficient algorithms.

One famous example is the expression 0/0, which is known as an indeterminate form because it can take on any value depending on further analysis."

In this book, we learn about several of the most common applications of differentiation. By understanding how to differentiate functions, we can gain insight into their behavior and solve optimization problems more easily. We’ve also seen how indeterminate forms can arise in different situations and learned some simple rules for dealing with them. So if you’re looking to become skilled, it’s important to understand the principles and applications of differentiation inside and out."

    "text": "19.1 Relative Extreme Values\nIf a function is defined on an open interval and if at some point in that interval the function reaches a maximum or minimum value (relative to that interval), then we say that the function has a relative extrema on that interval. A maximum or minimum value that occurs at an endpoint is not, by definition, a relative maximum nor a relative minimum. A relative maximum or relative minimum must occur in the interior of an interval.\nNow we define relative extrema and state the relative extrema theorem.\n\nDefinition 19.1 Let \\(f\\) be a function defined on an open interval \\(I\\) with \\(c\\in I\\).\n\nIf \\(f(c)\\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(I,\\) then \\(f(c)\\) is called a relative maximum of \\(f\\) on \\(I.\\)\nIf \\(f(c)\\leq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(I,\\) then \\(f(c)\\) is called a relative minimum of \\(f\\) on \\(I.\\)\nIf \\(c\\in I\\) and \\(f(c)\\) is either a relative maximum or a relative minimum then \\(f(c)\\) is a relative extrema, and we say that \\(f(c)\\) is a relative extreme value of \\(f\\).\n\n\nA relative maximum is sometimes called a local maximum .\nA relative minimum is sometimes called a local minimum .\nThe following proposition is sometimes called Fermat’s theorem due to acknowledgment that Fermat realized the result first. The following examples show that even when \\(f'(c)=0\\) there need not be a maximum or minimum at \\(c.\\) In other words, the converse of Fermat’s Theorem is false in general. Furthermore, there may be an extreme value when \\(f'(c)\\neq 0\\) or when \\(f'(c)\\) does not exist. We state Fermat’s wonderful observation as the Relative Extrema Theorem .\n::: {#thm- } [Relative Extrema Theorem] If \\(f\\) has a relative extremum at \\(c\\) and \\(f'(c)\\) exists then \\(f'(c)=0.\\) :::\n\nProof. Since \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(c,\\) \\(f'(c)\\) must be positive, zero, or negative. If \\[f'(c)=\\lim _{x\\to c}\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}>0\n\\] then there exists an interval \\((a,b)\\) containing \\(c\\) such that \\(\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}>0\\) for all \\(x\\neq c\\) in \\((a,b).\\) This produces the following inequalities for \\(x\\)-values in the interval \\((a,b).\\) If \\(x<c\\) then \\(f(x)<f(c)\\) and so \\(f(c)\\) is not a relative minimum. If \\(x>c\\) then \\(f(x)>f(c)\\) and so \\(f(c)\\) is not a relative maximum. So the assumption that \\(f'(c)>0\\) leads to a contradiction. Assuming that \\(f'(c)<0\\) will also lead to a similar contradiction. Thus it must be the case \\(f'(c)=0\\) as desired.\n\n\nExample 19.1 Determine if the Relative Extrema Theorem applies and if so find the relative extrema for the function \\[\nf(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n2x-3 & x<2/3 \\\\\n3-7x & x\\geq  2/3\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. The function \\(f\\) has its maximum value (local and absolute) at \\(x=2/3,\\) but we can not find this absolute maximum by setting \\(f'(x)=0\\) because \\(f'\\) is not defined at \\(x=2/3\\). Since \\(f'(2/3)\\) does not exist the Relative Extrema Theorem does not apply.\n\n\nExample 19.2 Determine if the Relative Extrema Theorem applies and if so find the relative extrema for the function \\(h(x)=x^3+4\\).\n\n\nSolution. Since \\(h'(x)=3x^2\\) we have \\(h'(0)=0.\\) However, since \\(h\\) does not have a relative extremum at \\(x=0\\) the Relative Extrema Theorem does not hold."

    "section": "19.2 Critical Numbers",
    "text": "19.2 Critical Numbers\nIn general, the critical numbers divide the domain of a function into intervals on which the sign of the derivative remains the same, either positive or negative. Therefore, if a function is defined on that interval it is either increasing or decreasing on that interval. In particular the graph can not change directions on that interval. This is the crucial idea behind using the derivative to analyze graphs of function.\n\nDefinition 19.2 A real number \\(c\\) is called a critical number of the function \\(f\\) provided:\n\n\\(c\\) is in the domain of \\(f\\) and \\(f'(c)=0\\) or\n\\(c\\) is in the domain of \\(f\\) and \\(c\\) is not in the domain of \\(f'\\).\n\n\nOr said differently, a critical number of a function \\(f\\) is a real number \\(c\\) in the domain of \\(f\\) such that \\(f'(c)=0\\) or \\(f'(c)\\) does not exist.\n\nTheorem 19.1 If \\(f\\) is a continuous function and has a relative extremum at \\(c,\\) then \\(c\\) is a critical number of \\(f.\\)\n\n\nExample 19.3 Find the critical numbers, if there are any, for the function \\[\nf(x)=|x+2|-3.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. The function \\(f(x)=|x+2|-3\\) can be rewritten as a piecewise function as \\[\nf(x)=\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nx-1 & x\\geq  -2 \\\\\n-x-5 & x<-2\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\] The graph of the function \\(f\\) has a sharp corner at \\(x=-2\\) which can be seen by evaluating the left derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x=-2\\) and the right derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x=-2\\). Therefore \\(f'\\) is not defined at \\(x=-2\\). Since \\(f'\\) is defined everywhere else and \\(f'\\) is not 0 anywhere the only critical number is \\(-2.\\)\n\n\nExample 19.4 Find the critical numbers, if there are any, for the function \\[\ng(x)=x^3+2.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. The function \\(g\\) has derivative \\(g'(x)=3x^2\\) which is defined for all real numbers. Notice that at \\(x=0,\\) \\(g'(0)=0\\) and so 0 is a critical number. Also notice that \\(x=0\\) is not a relative extrema nor an absolute extrema. In summary, critical numbers allow us to check if there are any extrema at that point, but not conversely.\n\n\nExample 19.5 Find the critical numbers, if there are any, for the function \\[\nh(x)=\\sin  x.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. The function \\(h(x)=\\sin x\\) has derivative \\(h'(x)=\\cos x\\) which is defined for all real numbers. So to check for extrema we will need to determine where \\(h'(x)=0.\\) This occurs at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi }{2}+\\pi k\\) where \\(k\\) is any integer. In fact, in this case the absolute extrema of \\(h\\) occurs at these values.\n\n\nExample 19.6 Find the critical numbers, if there are any, for the function \\(f(x)=x^{2/3}(1-x)\\).\n\n\nSolution. The function \\(f\\) has derivative, \\[f'(x)=\\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}(1-x)+x^{2/3}(-1)=\\frac{2-5 x}{3 x^{1/3}}\\] and so we need to check for any \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\) such that \\(f'(x)=0\\) or \\(f'(x)\\) is undefined. We see that \\(f'\\) is undefined for \\(x=0;\\) and \\(f'(x)=0\\) for \\(x=\\frac{2}{5}.\\) So for this function \\(f\\) there are two critical numbers namely \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\frac{2}{5}.\\)\n\n\nExample 19.7 Find the critical numbers, if there are any, for the function \\[\nf(x)=\\sqrt{9-x^2}.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. The function \\(f\\) has derivative, \\[\nf'(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(9-x^2\\right)^{-1/2}(-2x)=-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{9-x^2}}\n\\] and so we need to check for any \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\) such that \\(f'(x)=0\\) or \\(f'(x)\\) is undefined. We see that \\(f'\\) is undefined for \\(x=\\pm 3;\\) and \\(f'(x)=0\\) for \\(x=0.\\) So there are three critical numbers of \\(f\\) namely, \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pm 3.\\)\n\n\nExample 19.8 Find the critical numbers, if there are any, for the function \\[\n\\displaystyle f(x)=\\frac{x^2}{x^2-3}.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. The function \\(f\\) has derivative, \\[f'(x)=\\frac{\\left(x^2-3\\right)2x-x^2(2x)}{\\left(x^2-3\\right)^2}=\\frac{-6 x}{\\left(-3+x^2\\right)^2}\\] and so we need to check for any \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\) such that \\(f'(x)=0\\) or if \\(f'(x)\\) is undefined. We see that \\(f'\\) is undefined for \\(x=\\pm \\sqrt{3};\\) and \\(f'(x)=0\\) for \\(x=0.\\) So there are three critical numbers of \\(f\\) namely \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pm \\sqrt{3}.\\)\n\n\nExample 19.9 Find the critical numbers, if there are any, for the function \\[\n\\displaystyle f(x)=\\ln  \\sqrt{x-2}.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. The function \\(f\\) has derivative, \\[\nf'(x)=\\frac{1}{2(-2+x)}\n\\] and so we need to check for any \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\) such that \\(f'(x)=0\\) or \\(f'(x)\\) is undefined. We see that \\(f'\\) is undefined for \\(x=2;\\) and there are no real numbers with \\(f'(x)=0.\\) One might be tempted to say that there is one critical numbers of \\(x=2.\\) However, \\(x=2\\) is not a critical number because \\(x=2\\) is not in the domain of \\(f(x)=\\ln \\sqrt{x-2}.\\)"

The trigonometric functions sine and cosine have global maximum and global minimum; and since these functions are periodic they attain these values periodically. However, the functions secant, cosecant, tangent and cotangent do not have any absolute maximum and absolute minimum values on their natural domain.

Basically Rolle’s theorem states that if a function is differentiable on an open interval, continuous at the endpoints, and if the function values are equal at the endpoints, then it has at least one horizontal tangent. Of course if the function is constant this is automatically true for all points in the interval. So the point is that Rolle’s theorem guarantees us at least one point in the interval where there will be a horizontal tangent.

The mean in the Mean Value Theorem is referring to the mean (average) rate of change of \\(f\\) in the interval.\nNext we detail Rolle’s Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem. We provide examples and illustrate why the hypotheses of these two theorems are necessary. We also give applications and detail two other theorems which are consequences of the Mean Value Theorem. We also emphasize that the Mean Value Theorem tells us that between two fixed points of time, the instantaneous velocity is equal to the average velocity.\n::: {#thm- } [Mean Value Theorem] Let \\(f\\) be a function that is continuous on \\([a,b]\\) and differentiable on \\((a,b).\\) Then there exists at least one number \\(c\\) in \\((a,b)\\) such that \\[\nf'(c)=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.\n\\] :::\n\nProof.

Let \\(t=0\\) be the time when the truck passes the first patrol car. The time when it passes the second patrol car is \\(1.5/60\\) hour. By letting \\(s(t)\\) represent the distance (in miles) travelled by the truck, we have \\(s(0)=0\\) and \\(s(1.5/60)=1.2.\\) So the average velocity is \\[\n\\frac{s\\left(\\frac{1.5}{60}\\right)-s(0)}{\\frac{1.5}{60}-0}=\\frac{1.2}{\\frac{1.5}{60}}=48.0 \\text{  mph}\n\\] Assuming that the position function is differentiable, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem to conclude that the truck must have been traveling at a rate of 48 miles per hour sometime during the one and half minutes."

First we find the critical numbers of \\(f\\) by solving \\(f'(x)=0\\) and determining where \\(f'(x)\\) is undefined but \\(f(x)\\) is defined.

    "text": "23.4 Horizontal Asymptotes\nIn mathematics, the symbol \\(\\infty\\) is not a number, rather it is used to describe the process of unrestricted growth or the result of such a growth.\n\nDefinition 23.6 The line \\(y=L\\) is called a horizontal asymptote of the curve \\(y=f(x)\\) if either \\(\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }f(x)=L\\) or \\(\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} f(x)=L.\\)\n\n::: {#thm- } If \\(f\\) is a rational functions of the form:\n\\[\nf(x)=\\frac{a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\\cdots +a_nx^n}{b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\\cdots +b_mx^m}\n\\] where \\(n\\) is the degree of the polynomial in the numerator and \\(m\\) is the degree of the polynomial in the denominator, then the horizontal asymptote of the curve \\(y=f(x)\\) is determined by the following.\n\nIf \\(n=m,\\) then \\(y=\\frac{a_n}{b_m}\\) is the horizontal asymptote.\nIf \\(n<m,\\) then \\(y=0\\) is the horizontal asymptote.\nIf \\(n>m,\\) then there is no horizontal asymptote, but rather a slant (oblique) asymptote and can be found be using long division. :::\n\n\nExample 23.10 Find the horizontal asymptote of the graph of the function \\[\nf(x)=\\frac{(1-x)(2+x)}{(1+2x)(2-3x)}.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. The degree of the numerator \\((1-x)(2+x)=-x^2-x+2\\) is 2 and the degree of the denominator \\((1+2x)(2-3x)=-6 x^2+x+2\\) is 2 we divide both numerator and denominator by \\(x^2\\) and using the properties of limits, we have \\[\n%\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} f(x)=\n\\lim_{x\\to \\pm\\infty} \\frac{-x^2-x+2}{-6 x^2+x+2}=\n%\\lim_{x\\to \\pm\\infty} \\frac{\\frac{-x^2-x+2}{x^2}}{\\frac{-6 x^2+x+2}{x^2}}=\n\\lim_{x\\to \\pm\\infty} \\frac{\\frac{-x^2}{x^2}-\\frac{x}{x^2}+\\frac{2}{x^2}}{\\frac{-6 x^2}{x^2}+\\frac{x}{x^2}+\\frac{2}{x^2}}=\n\\frac{-1-0+0}{-6+0+0}=6\n\\] Therefore the only horizontal asymptote of the graph of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(y=6.\\)\n\n\nExample 23.11 Find the horizontal asymptote of the graph of the function \\[\nf(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2x^2+1}}{3x-5}.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. Dividing both numerator and denominator by \\(x\\) and using the properties of limits, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\frac{\\sqrt{2x^2+1}}{3x-5}\n=\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\frac{\\sqrt{2+\\frac{1}{x^2}}}{3-\\frac{5}{x}}\n=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\left(2+\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)}}{\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\left(3-\\frac{5}{x}\\right)}\n=\\frac{\\sqrt{2+0}}{3-5(0)}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore the line \\(y=\\left.\\sqrt{2}\\right/3\\) is a horizontal asymptote. It is also important to realize that \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty }\\frac{\\sqrt{2x^2+1}}{3x-5}\n& =\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty }\\frac{\\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt{2x^2+1}}{3-\\frac{5}{x}} \\\\\n& =\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty }\\frac{\\left(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{x^2}}\\right)\\sqrt{2x^2+1}}{3-\\frac{5}{x}}\n=\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty }\\frac{-\\sqrt{2+\\frac{1}{x^2}}}{3-\\frac{5}{x}}\n=-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, the line \\(y=\\left.-\\sqrt{2}\\right/3\\) is another horizontal asymptote.\n\n\nExample 23.12 Find all horizontal asymptotes of the graph of the function \\[\nf(x)=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt[4]{x^4+1}}.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. Dividing both numerator and denominator by \\(x\\) and using the properties of limits, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\frac{x}{\\sqrt[4]{x^4+1}}\n& =\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\frac{\\frac{x}{x}}{\\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt[4]{x^4+1}}\n=\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{x^4+1}{x^4}}} \\\\\n& =\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{1+\\frac{1}{x^4}}}\n=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\left(1+\\frac{1}{x^4}\\right)}}\n=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{1+0}}=1.\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, the line \\(y=1\\) is a horizontal asymptote. In computing the limit \\(x\\to -\\infty\\) we must remember that for \\(x<0,\\) we have \\(\\sqrt[4]{x^4}=-x,\\) so when we divide the numerator by \\(x,\\) when \\(x<0\\) we have, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty }\\frac{x}{\\sqrt[4]{x^4+1}}\n& =\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty }\\frac{\\frac{x}{x}}{\\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt[4]{x^4+1}} \\\\\n& =\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{x^4}}\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{x^4+1}{x^4}}}\n=\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }\\frac{1}{-\\text{  }\\sqrt[4]{1+\\frac{1}{x^4}}}\n=-1.\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, the horizontal asymptotes are \\(y=\\pm 1.\\)"

    "text": "24.2 Vertical Tangents and Cusps\nThere are four possibilities for unbounded behavior of a derivative \\(f'(x)\\) around a given real number \\(c.\\)\n\nDefinition 24.1 Suppose the function \\(f\\) is continuous at the point \\(P(c,f(c)).\\)\n\nThe graph of \\(f\\) has a vertical tangent at \\(P\\) if one of the following holds.\n\\(\\lim _{x\\to c^+}f'(x)=\\lim _{x\\to c^-}f'(x)=+\\infty\\)\n\\(\\lim _{x\\to c^+}f'(x)=\\lim _{x\\to c^-}f'(x)=-\\infty\\)\nThe graph of \\(f\\) has a cusp at \\(P\\) if one of the following holds.\n\\(\\lim _{x\\to c^+}f'(x)=+\\infty\\) and \\(\\lim _{x\\to c^-}f'(x)=-\\infty\\)\n\\(\\lim _{x\\to c^+}f'(x)=-\\infty\\) and \\(\\lim _{x\\to c^-}f'(x)=+\\infty\\)\n\n\n\nExample 24.1 Sketch the graph of \\[\nf(x)=3x^{3/5}\\left(5-x-4x^2\\right)\n\\] and explain why there is a vertical tangent at \\(x=0\\).\n\n\nSolution. Using the product rule the derivative of the function \\(f\\) is \\[\\begin{align*}\nf'(x) & =\\frac{9}{5}x^{-2/5}\\left(5-x-4x^2\\right)+3x^{3/5}(-1-8x) \\\\\n& =\\frac{9\\left(5-x-4x^2\\right)}{5x^{2/5}}+\\frac{\\left(5x^{2/5}\\right)\\left(3x^{3/5}\\right)(-1-8x)}{5x^{2/5}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{9\\left(5-x-4x^2\\right)}{5x^{2/5}}+\\frac{15x(-1-8x)}{5x^{2/5}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{45-24 x-156 x^2}{5 x^{2/5}}.\n\\end{align*}\\] To determine any vertical tangents we consider where \\(f'(x)\\) is undefined. Notice that at \\(x=0\\) the derivative is undefined but \\(f(0)=0.\\) Thus, the point \\((0,0)\\) is a candidate for a being a vertical tangent to the graph of \\(f.\\) We check the following limits to determine if \\((0,0)\\) is a vertical tangent. Since \\(45-24 x-156 x^2\\to 45\\) and \\(5 x^{2/5}\\to -\\infty\\) as \\(x\\to 0^-,\\) \\[\\lim _{x\\to 0^-}\\frac{45-24 x-156 x^2}{5 x^{2/5}}=+\\infty.\\] Since \\(45-24 x-156 x^2\\to 45\\) and \\(5 x^{2/5}\\to -\\infty\\) as \\(x\\to 0^-,\\) \\[\\lim _{x\\to 0^+}\\frac{45-24 x-156 x^2}{5 x^{2/5}}=+\\infty.\\] Therefore the function \\(f\\) has a vertical tangent at \\((0,0)\\) which can be seen from the sketch of the graph of \\(f.\\) (see Figure ~\\(\\ref{fig:graph17}\\)).\n\n\nExample 24.2 Sketch the graph of \\(f(x)=x^{2/3}\\left(x^2+5x-20\\right)\\) and explain why there is a cusp at \\(x=0\\).\n\n\nSolution. Using the product rule we find the derivative as \\[\\begin{align*}\nf'(x) & =\\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}\\left(x^2+5x-20\\right)+x^{2/3}(2x+5)  \\\\\n& =\\frac{2\\left(x^2+5x-20\\right)}{3x^{1/3}}+\\frac{3x^{1/3}x^{2/3}(2x+5)}{3x^{1/3}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{2x^2+10x-40}{3x^{1/3}}+\\frac{3x(2x+5)}{3x^{1/3}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{2x^2+10x-40}{3x^{1/3}}+\\frac{6x^2+15x}{3x^{1/3}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{8 x^2+25 x-40}{3 \\sqrt[3]{x}}.\n\\end{align*}\\] To determine any cusps we consider where \\(f'(x)\\) is undefined. Notice that at \\(x=0\\) the derivative is undefined but \\(f(0)=0.\\) Thus the point \\((0,0)\\) is a candidate for a being a cusp for the graph of the function \\(f\\). We check the following limits to determine if \\((0,0)\\) is a cusp. Since \\(8x^2+25x-40\\to -40\\) and \\(3 \\sqrt[3]{x}\\to -\\infty\\) as \\(x\\to 0^-,\\)\n\\[\\lim _{x\\to 0^-}\\frac{8 x^2+25 x-40}{3 \\sqrt[3]{x}}=+\\infty.\\] Since \\(8x^2+25x-40\\to -40\\) and \\(3 \\sqrt[3]{x}\\to +\\infty\\) as \\(x\\to 0^+,\\) \\[\\lim _{x\\to 0^+}\\frac{8 x^2+25 x-40}{3 \\sqrt[3]{x}}=-\\infty .\\] Therefore the function \\(f\\) has a cusp at \\((0,0)\\) which can be seen from the sketch of the graph of \\(f.\\) (see Figure ~\\(\\ref{fig:graph18}\\)).\n\n\nExample 24.3 Determine any vertical tangents and cusps for the function \\[\nf(x)=x^{2/3} (x - 1)^{1/3}.\n\\]\n\n\nSolution. To find the vertical tangents and cusps we check where the first derivative is undefined. The derivative of \\(f\\) is \\[f'(x)=\\frac{x^{2/3}}{3 (x-1)^{2/3}}+\\frac{2 \\sqrt[3]{x-1}}{3 \\sqrt[3]{x}}=\\frac{3 x-2}{3 (x-1)^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{x}}.\\] Therefore the points \\((0,0)\\) and \\((1,0)\\) are candidates for where a vertical tangent and cusp might occur. The function \\(f\\) has a vertical asymptote at \\(x=1\\) since \\[\n\\lim_{x\\to 1^-}f'(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 1^-} \\frac{3 x-2}{3 (x-1)^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{x}} = +\\infty   \n%\\lim_{x\\to 1^+}f'(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 1^+} \\frac{3 x-2}{3 (x-1)^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{x}} = +\\infty  \n\\] The function \\(f\\) has a cusp at \\(x=0\\) since \\[\\lim_{x\\to 0^-}f'(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0^-} \\frac{3 x-2}{3 (x-1)^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{x}} = +\\infty  \n% \\lim_{x\\to 0^+}f'(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{3 x-2}{3 (x-1)^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{x}} = -\\infty .\n\\] (see Figure ~\\(\\ref{fig:graph19}\\)).\n\n\nExample 24.4 Sketch the graph of the rational function \\[\nf(x)=\\frac{2x^2}{x^2-1}\n\\] showing all special features.\n\n\nSolution. The domain of \\(f\\) is \\[\n\\left\\{x\\left|x^2-1\\neq 0\\right.\\right\\}\n=\\{x|\\neq \\pm 1\\}\n=(-\\infty ,-1)\\cup (-1,1)\\cup (1,+\\infty ).\n\\] The \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) intercepts are both \\(0.\\) Since \\(f(-x)=f(x)\\) the function is even and so the curve is symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis. Since \\[\n\\lim _{x\\to \\pm \\infty}\\frac{2x^2}{x^2-1}\n=\\lim _{x\\to \\pm \\infty}\\frac{2}{1-\\frac{1}{x^2}}=2\n\\] the line \\(y=2\\) is a horizontal asymptote. Since the denominator is 0 when \\(x\\pm 1,\\) we compute the following limits: \\[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\displaystyle\n\\lim _{x\\to 1^+}\\frac{2x^2}{x^2-1}\n=+\\infty  &  \\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to 1^-}\\frac{2x^2}{x^2-1}\n=-\\infty  \\\\\n\\displaystyle\n\\lim _{x\\to -1^+}\\frac{2x^2}{x^2-1}\n=-\\infty  &  \\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to -1^-}\\frac{2x^2}{x^2-1}\n=+\\infty\n\\end{array}\n\\] Therefore, the lines \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-1\\) are vertical asymptotes. Next we find the derivative function. \\[ f'(x)=\\frac{4x\\left(x^2-1\\right)-2x^2(2x)}{\\left(x^2-1\\right)^2}=\\frac{-4x}{\\left(x^2-1\\right)^2}.\\] Since \\(f'(x)>0\\) when \\(x<0\\) \\((x\\neq -1)\\) and \\(f'(x)<0\\) when \\(x>0\\) \\((x\\neq 1),\\) \\(f\\) is increasing on \\((-\\infty ,-1)\\) and \\((-1,0)\\) and decreasing on \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,+\\infty ).\\) The only critical number is \\(x=0.\\) Since \\(f'\\) changes sign from positive to negative at \\(0,\\) \\(f(0)=0\\) is a local maximum by the First Derivative Test. Also, \\[f''(x)=\\frac{-4\\left(x^2-1\\right)^2+4x(2)\\left(x^2-1\\right)(2x)}{\\left(x^2-1\\right)^4}=\\frac{12x^2+4}{\\left(x^2-1\\right)^3}\\] Since \\(12x^2+4>0\\) for all \\(x,\\) we have \\(f''(x)>0 \\Longleftrightarrow x^2-1>0 \\Longleftrightarrow |x|>1\\) and \\(f''(x)<0 \\Longleftrightarrow |x|<1.\\) Thus the curve is concave downward on the intervals \\((-\\infty ,-1)\\) and \\((1,+\\infty )\\) and concave downward on \\((-1,1).\\) There is no point of inflection since \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\) are not in the domain of \\(f.\\) (see Figure ~\\(\\ref{fig:graph20}\\)).\n\n\nExample 24.5 Sketch the graph of the trigonometric function \\[\nf(x)=2 \\cos  x+\\sin  2 x\n\\] showing all special features.\n\n\nSolution. The domain of the function \\(f\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}.\\) The \\(y\\)-intercept is \\((0,2)\\) since \\(f(0)=2.\\) The \\(x\\)-intercepts occur when \\(2 \\cos x+\\sin 2x=2 \\cos x+2 \\sin x \\cos x=2 \\cos x(1+\\sin x)=0\\) which is precisely when \\(x=\\pi /2\\) and \\(x=3\\pi /2\\), because we need only consider \\([0,2\\pi ]\\) since function is periodic via, \\[f(x+2\\pi )=2 \\cos  (x+2\\pi )+\\sin  [2(x+2\\pi )]=2\\cos  x+\\sin  2x=f(x).\\] There are no vertical asymptotes nor horizontal asymptotes. The first derivative of \\(f\\) is, \\[\\begin{align*}\nf'(x)& =-2 \\sin  x+2 \\cos  2x =-2(2 \\sin x-1)(\\sin x+1).\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, \\(f'(x)=0\\) when \\(\\sin x=1/2\\) or when \\(\\sin x=-1,\\) so in \\([0,2\\pi ]\\) we only consider the critical numbers \\(x=\\pi /6\\), \\(x=5\\pi /6,\\) and \\(x=3\\pi /2.\\) Applying the First Derivative Test we find: \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|l}\n\\text{Interval} & f & f' & \\text{Conclusion} \\\\ \\hline\n0<x<\\pi /6 &   & + & \\text{increasing} \\\\\nx=\\pi /6 & 3\\left.\\sqrt{3}\\right/2 & 0 & \\text{relative maximum}  \\\\\n\\pi /6<x<5\\pi /6 &   & - & \\text{decreasing} \\\\\nx=5\\pi /6 & -3\\left.\\sqrt{3}\\right/2 & 0 & \\text{relative minimum} \\\\\n5\\pi /6<x<3\\pi /2 &   & + & \\text{increasing} \\\\\nx=3\\pi /2 & 0 & 0 & \\text{horizontal tangent} \\\\\n3\\pi /2<x<2\\pi  &   & + & \\text{increasing}\n\\end{array}\n\\] The second derivative of \\(f\\) is, \\[ f''(x)=-2\\cos  x-4 \\sin  2x=-2 \\cos  x (1+4 \\sin  x)\\] so the second order critical numbers are \\(x=\\pi /2,3\\pi /2, \\alpha _1,\\) and \\(\\alpha _2\\) where \\(\\sin \\alpha _1=-\\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(\\sin  \\alpha _2=-\\frac{1}{4}.\\) Applying the Concavity Test we find, \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|l}\n\\text{Interval} & f & f'' & \\text{Conclusion} \\\\ \\hline\n0<x<\\pi /2 &   & - & \\text{concave down} \\\\\nx=\\pi /2 & 0 & 0 & \\text{inflection point} \\\\\n\\pi /2<x<\\alpha _1 &   & + & \\text{concave up} \\\\\nx=\\alpha _1 & f\\left(\\alpha _1\\right) & 0 & \\text{inflection point} \\\\\n\\alpha _1<x<3\\pi /2 &   & - & \\text{concave down} \\\\\nx=3\\pi /2 & 0 & 0 & \\text{inflection point} \\\\\n3\\pi /2<x<\\alpha _2 &   & + & \\text{concave up} \\\\\nx=\\alpha _2 & f\\left(\\alpha _2\\right) & 0 & \\text{inflection point} \\\\\n\\alpha _2<x<2\\pi  &   & - & \\text{concave down}\n\\end{array}\n\\]"

    "text": "25.1 Optimization Procedures\nIn this section we give a few examples on how to set up a function to be optimized using its derivative. In general, the first step in solving an application problem is to understand the problem; maybe ask what are the unknowns? and what are the given quantities? Then the next best step is usually to draw a picture, labeling the unknowns and introducing notation. The final step should always be to check the solution to see that it makes sense for the given questions.\nAn optimization procedure is a step-by-step procedure to solve an application problem using calculus; and in particular, using derivatives. Here is a typical optimization procedure:\n\nSketch a graph or draw a diagram.\nIntroduce mathematical notation.\nExpress information as expressions, equations and functions.\nFormulate the problem mathematically by stating the knowns and unknowns.\nState the knowns and unknowns.\nIdentify needed theorems and validate their hypotheses. Apply the theorem.\nSolve the mathematical problem.\nAnswer the original problem in terms of the given language.\n\nWe will illustrate this optimization procedure in the following examples."

It’s crazy to think about, but it turns out to be incredibly useful.\nSo integration is important because it helps us calculate all sorts of things that we wouldn’t be able to calculate without it.

Whereas differentiation allows you to find the slope of a curve at any given point, integration allows you to find the area under a curve between two points. Indefinite integration is integration without limits, which means that you are finding the area under the curve for all points between two given points.\nAs with differentiation, there are many rules and properties that you can use to simplify integration problems. However, it is still generally a complex process. Nevertheless, indefinite integration is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems in mathematics and physics. And who knows, maybe one day you’ll be able to use it to find the area under your favorite curve!\nThere are two main types of integration: indefinite and definite. Indefinite integration is when we don’t have bounds on our integrals, while definite integration has specific boundaries. Both are important, and each has its own uses.\nSo whether you’re just getting started with integration or you’re a seasoned pro, I hope this article gives you a better understanding of what indefinite integration is and how it works."

Riemann sums involve taking the area under the curve and dividing it into small intervals, each of which can be approximated by a rectangle. The heights of the rectangles are determined by the function values at the endpoint of each interval. Then, all of the rectangles are added together to approximate the area under the curve.\nAlthough Riemann sums may seem like a lot of work, they can actually make integration easier because they provide a way to break up the area into manageable pieces. Plus, once you get the hang of it, integration using Riemann sums can be quite satisfying. So next time you’re stuck trying to integrate a function, give Riemann sums a try!"

To do this, we divide the curve into a bunch of small rectangles, calculate the area of each rectangle, and then add them all up. The more rectangles we use, the more accurate our answer will be.\nBut what if we want to be really precise? That’s where integration comes in. Integration is just a fancy way of saying “area under the curve,” and it gives us a way to calculate the exact area of any shape, no matter how complex. So if you’re ever stuck trying to find the area of something, remember: integration is your friend!\nMore formally, integration is the process of finding a function that represents the rate of change of a quantity over time.\nThe definite integral is a tool that allows us to calculate the exact area under a curve. It is defined as the limit of the sum of an infinite number of small rectangles, each infinitesimally close to the curve. The height of each rectangle is equal to the value of the function at its x-coordinate, and the width of each rectangle is infinitesimally small. As the number of rectangles approaches infinity, the sum of their areas approaches the true value of the integral.\nThis definition may seem confusing at first, but it provides a precise way to calculate the area under any smooth curve. In practice, integration is used to solve problems in physics, engineering, and finance. It can be used to calculate things like displacement, velocity, and acceleration. It can also be used to find out how much money will be required to fund a project over time.\nIn short, integration is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems."

Find the demand function \\(p(x).\\)\n\n\nSolution. Since \\[\nR(x)=\\int R'(x)dx=\\int (240+0.1x) \\, dx=240 x+0.05x^2+C\n\\] and because \\(R(x)=x p(x),\\) where \\(p(x)\\) is the demand function, we must have \\(R(0)=0\\) so that \\(240(0)+0.05(0)+C+0\\) yielding \\(C=0\\) and \\[\np(x)=\\frac{R(x)}{x}=\\frac{240x+0.05x^2}{x}=240+0.05x.\n\\]\n\n\nExample 29.8 A ball is thrown upward with a speed of 48 ft/s from the edge of a cliff 432 feet above the ground.

The motion is vertical and we choose the positive direction to be upward. At time \\(t\\) the distance above the ground is \\(s(t)\\) and the velocity \\(v(t)\\) is decreasing. Therefore the acceleration must be negative \\(a(t)=\\frac{dv}{dt}=-32.\\) Taking the antiderivative\n\\[\nv(t)=\\int a(t) \\, dt=-32t+C.\n\\] To determine \\(C\\) we use the given information of \\(v(0)=48.\\) Thus \\(v(0)=-32(0)+C=48\\) and so \\(C=48\\) and \\(v(t)=-32t+48.\\) It follows the ball reaches its maximum height at \\(v(t)=0\\) which means \\(t=\\frac{48}{32}s=1.5s.\\) Taking the antiderivative\n\\[\ns(t)=v'(t)=\\int (-32t+48) \\, dt=-16 t^2+48 t+K\n\\] and using \\(s(0)=432\\) we find that \\(s(0)=-16 (0)^2+48 (0)+K=432\\) and so \\(K=432.\\) Therefore the height function is \\[\ns(t)=-16 t^2+48 t+432\n\\] and so the ball hits the ground when \\(s(t)=0\\) meaning \\(t=\\frac{3+3\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\approx 6.9 s\\) by using the quadratic formula.\n\n\nExample 29.9 A company has found that the rate of change of its average cost for a product is \\[\n\\bar{C}'(x)=\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{100}{x^2}\n\\] where \\(x\\) is the number of units and cost is in dollars.

The function that describes weekly attendance at this film is found by integration \\[\\begin{align*}\nA(t)& =\\int \\frac{dA}{dt} \\, dt\n=\\int \\left(\\frac{-100}{(t+10)^2}+\\frac{2000}{(t+10)^3}\\right) \\, dt \\\\\n& =\\int \\left(\\frac{-100}{(t+10)^2}+\\frac{2000}{(t+10)^3}\\right) \\, dt\n=\\frac{100}{t+10}-\\frac{1000}{(t+10)^2}+K\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(t\\) is in the time in weeks since release and \\(A\\) is attendance in millions.

The marginal cost is \\(\\overline{M C}=60\\sqrt{x+1}\\) and so the cost function is fond by integration \\(C(x)=\\int 60\\sqrt{x+1}dx=40 (1+x)^{3/2}+K\\) where \\(K\\) is a constant. Since \\(C(0)=340\\) we find \\(K=300\\) and so the cost function is \\(C(x)=40 (1+x)^{3/2}+30.\\) The marginal revenue is \\(\\overline{MR}=80x\\) and so the revenue function is found by integration \\(R(x)=\\int 80 xdx=40 x^2.\\) Thus the profit function for this product is \\[\nP(x)=R(x)-C(x)=40 x^2-40 (1+x)^{3/2}-300.\n\\] (a) The loss from the sale of 3 units is \\(P(3)=40 (3)^2-40 (1+(3))^{3/2}-300=-260\\) dollars.

Suppose that a particle starts from rest at \\(t=0\\) and moves along a straight line under the action of a constant force \\(F\\). Then, according to Newton’s second law of motion, the equation of motion is \\[\nF=m_0 \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{v}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\right).\n\\] Find the velocity and position functions of the particle. What happens to the velocity of the particle as time goes by?\n\n\nSolution. From \\(F=m_0 \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{v}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\right)\\) we find \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left[\\frac{v}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\right]=\\frac{F}{m_0}\n\\] which implies \\[\n\\frac{v}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\\int \\frac{F}{m_0} \\, dt = \\frac{F t}{m_0}+k\n\\] where \\(k\\) is a constant. But \\(v(0)=0\\), so \\(k=0\\). Therefore, \\[\n\\frac{v}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{Ft}{m_0}\n\\] and after solving for velocity \\[\nv=\\frac{c F t}{\\sqrt{m_0^2 c^2+F^2 t^2}}.\n\\] Next we find the position function, \\[\ns=\\int v(t) \\, dt =\\int \\frac{c F t}{\\sqrt{m_0^2 c^2+F^2 t^2}} \\, dt\n\\] Let \\(u=m_0^2 c^2+F^2 t^2\\) then \\(du = 2 F^2 t \\, dt\\). Then by substitution, \\[\ns=\\frac{c F}{2F^2} \\int \\frac{1}{u^{1/2}} \\, du\n= \\frac{c}{F} \\left( m_0^2 c^2+F^2 t^2 \\right)^{1/2} +C\n\\] where \\(C\\) is the constant of integration. Then \\(s(0)=0\\) which shows \\(C=-\\frac{c^2 m_0}{F}\\), so \\[\ns(t)=\\frac{c}{F}\\left( m_0^2 c^2+F^2 t^2 \\right)^{1/2} -\\frac{c^2 m_0}{F}.\n\\] Finally, \\[\n\\lim_{t\\to \\infty } v(t)= \\lim_{t\\to \\infty } \\frac{c F t}{\\sqrt{m_0^2+F^2 t^2}}\n= \\lim_{t\\to \\infty } \\frac{c F}{\\sqrt{\\frac{m_0^2 c^2}{t^2}+F^2}}\n=\\frac{c F}{F}=c\n\\] showing that its velocity approaches the speed of light."

    "text": "32.1 The Definition of the Definite Integral\nSuppose a bounded function \\(f\\) is given along with a closed interval \\([a,b]\\) on which \\(f\\) is defined. First we will partition the interval \\([a,b]\\) into \\(n\\) subintervals by choosing points \\(\\{x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}\\) arranged in such a way that \\[\na=x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \\cdots <x_{n-1}< x_n =b.\n\\] Call this partition \\(P\\). Now for \\(i=1, 2, \\ldots, n\\) the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) subinterval width is \\(\\Delta_i=x_i-x_{i-1}\\). The largest of these widths is called the norm of the partition \\(P\\) and is denoted by \\(\\norm{P}\\); that is, \\(\\norm{P}=\\max_{i=1,2,\\ldots,n} \\{\\Delta_i\\}\\). Choose a number (arbitrarily) from each subinterval, say \\(x_i^*\\). For \\(i=i,2,\\ldots,n\\) the number \\(x_i^*\\) chosen from the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) is called the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) subinterval representative of the partition \\(P\\). Then the sum \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*) \\Delta x_i\n\\] is called the Riemann sum associated with \\(f\\), the partition \\(P\\), the chosen subinterval representatives.\n\nDefinition 32.1 Let \\(f\\) be a bounded function defined on an interval \\([a,b]\\). Then the definite integral of \\(f\\) over \\([a,b]\\) is defined as \\[\n\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx := \\lim_{\\norm{P} \\to 0} \\sum_{k=1}^n f(c_k) \\Delta x.\n\\] if the limit exists for all partitions \\(P\\) of \\([a,b]\\) and all choices of \\(c_k\\) in \\([x_{k-1},x_k]\\).\nWhen the above limit exists, we say the Riemann sums of \\(f\\) on \\([a,b]\\) converge to the definite integral \\(I=\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\) and that \\(f\\) is integrable over \\([a,b]\\).\n\nFor special cases we can define particular kinds of Riemann sums. For example, if we choose equally spaced subintervals using \\(\\Delta x_i= \\Delta x =\\frac{b-a}{n}\\) and \\(x_i^*=a+k \\Delta x\\) for \\(i=1,2,\\ldots,n\\) then the Riemann sum formed is \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n f(a+k \\Delta x) \\Delta x\n\\] and the partition \\(P\\) used to form this Riemann sum is called a regular partition . For regular partitions, \\(\\norm{P}\\to 0\\) if and only if \\(n\\to \\infty\\) and so the definition of the definite integral sometimes is given as \\[\n\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx := \\lim_{n \\to \\infty } \\sum_{k=1}^n f(c_k) \\Delta x.\n\\]\n\nTheorem 32.1 If a function \\(f\\) is continuous on an interval \\([a,b]\\) then its definite integral over \\([a,b]\\) exists.\n\n\nExample 32.1 Express \\[\n\\lim_{\\norm{P}\\to 0 } \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sqrt{4-c_k^2} \\Delta x_k\n\\] where \\(P\\) is a partition of \\([0,1]\\), as a definite integral and find its value using geometry.\n\n\nSolution. See Figure \\(\\ref{fig:graph41}\\). Recall the area of a circle with radius 2 is \\(4\\pi\\). Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{4-x^2}\\). Since \\(f\\) is continuous on \\([0,1]\\),\n\\[\n\\pi =\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{4-x^2}\\, dx = \\lim_{\\norm{P}\\to 0 } \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sqrt{4-c_k^2} \\Delta x_k.\n\\]\n\n\nExample 32.2 Express \\[\n\\lim_{\\norm{P}\\to 0 } \\sum_{k=1}^n (\\tan c_k) \\Delta x_k\n\\] where \\(P\\) is a partition of \\([0,\\pi/4]\\), as a definite integral and find its approximate value using geometry.\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(f(x)=\\tan x\\). Since \\(f\\) is continuous on \\([0,\\pi/4]\\),\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\approx \\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\tan x\\, dx = \\lim_{\\norm{P}\\to 0 } \\sum_{k=1}^n (\\tan c_k) \\Delta x_k\n\\] since the area under the curve is approximately equal to the area under the triangle with vertices \\((0,0)\\), \\((\\pi/4,0)\\), and \\((\\pi/4,1)\\)."

Use (b) to find another estimate of the integral in (a).\n\n\n\nSolution. For (a) Since \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\) is decreasing on \\([0,1]\\), it follows the maximum of \\(f\\), \\(M\\) occurs at 0 with \\(M=1\\) and the minimum value of \\(f\\), \\(m\\) occurs at 1 with \\(m=1/2\\).

We will ask the question: what are the average values that \\(f\\) takes on over the interval \\([a,b]\\)? To answer this, we will sample a finite number of values of \\(f\\). For example, say we sample \\(n\\) values of \\(f\\) by dividing \\([a,b]\\) into \\(n\\) subintervals of equal width \\(\\Delta x=\\frac{b-a}{n}\\) and evaluating \\(f\\) at a point \\(c_k\\) in each subinterval.

Simply put, an integral is a way to calculate the area under a curve. This can be used to determine the velocity of an object, the volume of a three-dimensional object, or even the length of a curve. In essence, integrals allow us to determine things that would otherwise be impossible to calculate.\nOf course, integrals are just one part of calculus; there are also derivatives, limits, and so on. But without integrals, many of the things we take for granted would be impossible. So next time you see a complicated equation involving an integral, remember that it just represents someone’s attempt to calculate something important.\nThe applications of integration are vast and include finding the volume or mass of an object, calculating work done or energy transferred, and solving many types of differential equations.\nIn this book, we will explore the applications of integration and how to apply it in various situations. So if you’re ready to learn about the applications of integration, let’s get started!"

And while that may sound like a rather esoteric focus, the applications of integration are actually quite practical.\nFor example, consider a firm that wants to determine how much material to order for manufacturing a product. The company knows the length of the product and the amount of material required per unit length. To find out how much material to order, they need to integrate the function that represents the amount of material required over the length of the product.\nIn other words, they need to find the area between the curve representing the amount of material required and an axis. Similarly, if a company wants to calculate how much money it will save by reducing its energy consumption, it needs to find the area between the two functions representing its current and proposed energy consumption rates.\nAs these examples illustrate, integration is a powerful tool with numerous applications in the business world. So next time you see a calculus problem involving the area between curves, don’t be discouraged - remember that there’s a practical application for all that math!"

    "section": "35.3 Volumes of Solids of Revolution",
    "text": "35.3 Volumes of Solids of Revolution\nHave you ever wondered how engineers calculate the volume of irregularly shaped objects? The answer lies in a branch of mathematics called integral calculus. One of the applications of integration is calculating the volume of a solid object by revolving a two-dimensional shape around an axis. This technique is known as the method of volumes of solids of revolution. To use this method, you first need to identify a suitable axis of revolution. This is typically a line that passes through the center of the object.\nOnce you have chosen an axis, you need to determine the equation that describes the shape. For example, if you were calculating the volume of a cylindrical container, you would use the equation for a circle. You then need to integrate this equation to find the area enclosed by the shape. Finally, you need to multiply this area by the length of the axis of revolution to find the volume. Although it may seem like a lot of work, the method of volumes of solids of revolution can be used to calculate the volumes of all sorts of objects, from coffee cups to oil tanks.\nThe Disk Method is a simple way to find volumes, but it has its limitations. First, it only works for solids that are rotationally symmetric about one axis. Second, it only works for solids with flat or circular bases. However, despite these limitations, the disk method is still a useful tool for finding volumes and has applications in many different fields.\nThe Washer Method is a volume of solids of revolution technique that can be applied to a wide variety of applications of integration. In essence, the washer method calculates the volume of an object that has been revolved around an axis by cleverly dividing the object into infinitely thin slices, and then calculating the volume of each slice.\nThe key to understanding the washer method is to remember that each slice must have a constant cross-sectional area; otherwise, the volume calculation will be inaccurate. Once this concept is understood, the applications of the washer method are nearly endless. From calculating the volumes of simple objects like cylinders and spheres to more complex objects like cones and toruses, the Washer Method is a powerful tool.\nThe Shell Method is also one of the applications of integration that can be used to calculate the volumes of certain solids. This method is most often used when calculating the volumes of solids of revolution, which are created when a curve is rotated about an axis. The shell method involves slicing the solid into thin shells and then calculating the volume of each individual shell. This method can be used to calculate the volumes of solids with a variety of shapes, including cylinders, spheres, and cones. While the shell method can be somewhat tricky to master, it is a powerful tool for calculating the volumes of solids of revolution."

One of the most common applications of integration is finding the arc length of a curve. By using a small angle approximation, you can break up the arc into a series of straight line segments. To do this, you need to first break up the arc into small segments. Then, you take the length of each segment and multiply it by the corresponding width. Finally, you add up all of the lengths to get the total length of the arc.\nIt might sound complicated, but it’s actually quite simple. And once you know how to do it, you can apply this technique to all sorts of applications. So why not give it a try? Who knows, you might just find yourself getting addicted to integration!"

When an object is rotated about an axis, the resulting shape is known as a surface of revolution. By using integration, it’s possible to calculate the surface area of this type of object without having to take measurements of the individual components. This can be a particularly useful tool in engineering applications, where accurate measurements are crucial.\nWhen calculating the surface area of an object, we are essentially finding the amount of material required to cover the object. This process can be applied to both regular and irregular objects. For example, when we calculate the surface area of a cylinder, we are finding the amount of material needed to cover the curved sides. In general, however, calculating the surface area of an arbitrary object can be a very difficult task.\nHowever, by breaking the object down into smaller pieces, we can use integration to more easily calculate its surface area. This technique is particularly helpful for surfaces of revolution, which can be difficult to visualize. By using integration, we can more easily calculate the amount of material needed to cover these complex shapes."

    "text": "39.4 Partial Fractions\nThese techniques of integration have been developed over many centuries, with each new generation of mathematicians building on the work of their predecessors. One important area of research is the theory of partial fractions.\nPartial fractions is a mathematical technique used to integrate rational functions. In the simplest case, it involves breaking up a fraction into a sum of simpler fractions, each of which can be integrated more easily. However, partial fractions can also be used to integrate more complex rational functions. The key is to identify the structure of the function and then to apply the appropriate techniques of integration.\nPartial fractions are used to decompose a rational function into a sum of simpler functions, which makes it possible to integrate the function more easily. The first step in the process is to find the roots of the denominator polynomial. These roots are then used to split the denominator into a product of linear factors. The next step is to determine the coefficients of the partial fractions. This can be done by solving a system of linear equations, or by using a method known as undetermined coefficients. Once the coefficients are known, the final step is to integrate each partial fraction separately.\nAlthough partial fractions may seem like a daunting topic at first, with a little practice it is possible to master this important technique. With a little practice, partial fractions can be used to solve a wide variety of integrals."

However, improper integrals can be tricky to compute, due to the fact that they often involve infinity. As a result, there are a variety of techniques that can be used to tackle these integrals.\nThe most important thing is to make sure that the limits of integration are well-defined. Once this is done, you can use various techniques of integration to compute the improper integral. These techniques include integration by parts, partial fractions, and change of variables. With practice, you will be able to master these techniques and compute any improper integral.\nBut what exactly is an improper integral? Well, there are two types: type I and type II. A type I improper integral is one where the function diverges at one or both of the limits of integration. A type II improper integral is one where the function converges, but the limit of integration is infinite. In both cases, the integral just doesn’t exist in the usual sense.\nSo how do you deal with an improper integral? Well, intis chapter you’ll learn a few techniques that can be used, depending on the situation. So if you ever find yourself faced with an improper integral, don’t despair! There are techniques that can be used to deal with them. It just takes a little bit of creativity and thinking outside the box."

    "text": "43.1 The Method of Partial Fractions\nWe now concentrate on integrals of the form \\[\n\\label{frac}\n\\int \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \\, dx\n\\] where \\(P(x)\\) and \\(Q(x)\\) are polynomial functions. In the case when \\(Q(x)\\) is a constant, then the integration is accomplished using the power rule form before.\nIn the case when the degree of \\(P(x)\\) is larger than the degree of \\(Q(x)\\) we can use long division. For example, consider the integral \\[\n\\int \\frac{x^2}{x+1}\\, dx.\n\\] By long division, we have \\[  \n\\frac{x^2}{x+1} = x-1 + \\frac{1}{x+1}\n\\] Using the power rule and the natural logarithmic function we can easily integrate, \\[\n\\label{intfrac}\n\\int \\frac{x^2}{x+1}\\, dx = \\frac{1}{2} x-x +\\ln |x+1| +C\n\\] where \\(C\\) is an arbitrary constant. The method of partial fractions assumes that the fraction in the integrand is always irreducible, meaning the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.\nThe method of partial fractions takes advantages of the fact that certain fractions are easy to integrate using the logarithmic function. For example, in \\(\\eqref{intfrac}\\), the integral \\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{x+1}\\, dx\n\\] is immediate. So our goal is to be able to decomposition a complex fraction into simpler fractions which can be integrated easier. For example, notice that \\[\n\\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-8} = \\frac{1}{x-2} +\\frac{2}{x+4}.\n\\] We ask, which is easier to integrate: the left or the right hand side?\nTo begin the process of partial fractions we factor \\(Q(x)\\) into factors of the form \\[\n(ax+b)^n \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad  (ax^2 +bx+c)^n\n\\] where \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) are irreducible. We then apply algebraic techniques to solve for the missing coefficients that decomposition \\(P(x)/Q(x)\\) into its partial fractions."

    "text": "44.1 Infinite Limits of integration\nUntil now, our regions of integration have been bounded regions. By this we mean that when evaluating \\[\n\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx\n\\] we are integrating \\(f\\) over a bounded interval \\([a,b]\\) and the range of \\(f\\) is also a bounded region. We will now discuss more general regions of integration such as \\((a,+\\infty)\\), \\((-\\infty, b)\\), and \\((-\\infty, +\\infty)\\). Consider for example the following diagram. We will use this to define \\(\\int_a^{+\\infty} f(x) \\, dx\\) as a limit. Similarly we wil define \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{b} f(x) \\, dx\\) as a limit by considering the diagram. In either case these integrals are said to be . There are other cases to consider, but in all cases, we will define an using a limit of an already known integral.\n\nDefinition 44.1 Suppose that \\(f\\) is a continuous function.\n\nThe improper integral of \\(f\\) over the interval \\([a,+\\infty)\\) is defined to be \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_a^{+\\infty} f(x) \\, dx  = \\lim_{b\\to +\\infty} \\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx. \\end{equation}\\]\nThe improper integral of \\(f\\) over the interval \\([-\\infty,b)\\) is defined to be \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_{-\\infty}^b f(x) \\, dx  = \\lim_{a\\to -\\infty} \\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx. \\end{equation}\\]\nThe improper integral of \\(f\\) over the interval \\((-\\infty,+\\infty)\\) is defined to be \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f(x) \\, dx  =\\int_{-\\infty}^c f(x)\\, dx + \\int^{+\\infty}_c f(x)\\, dx.\\end{equation}\\]\n\nWhenever the limit exists the integral is said to converge, and otherwise diverge.\n\n\nExample 44.1 Determine whether the improper integral \\(\\int_e^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x\\ln^2 x}\\, dx\\) converges or diverges.\n\n\nSolution.

We find the integral converges since \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{-\\infty}^0 \\frac{1}{x^2+2x+5}\\, dx\n& = \\lim_{a\\to -\\infty} \\int_{a}^0 \\frac{1}{x^2+2x+5}\\, dx \\\\\n& = \\lim_{a\\to -\\infty} \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x+1)\\right)\\right]_a^0 \\\\\n& = \\lim_{a\\to -\\infty} \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\tan^{-1}\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(a+1)\\right)\\right]\n= \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\end{align*}\\] as desired.\n\n\nExample 44.4 Determine whether the improper integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{e^x}{1+e^{2x}}\\, dx\\) converges or diverges.\n\n\nSolution. We consider the following two limits \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{e^x}{1+e^{2x}}\\, dx\n& = \\lim_{a\\to-\\infty } \\int_{a}^{0} \\frac{e^x}{1+e^{2x}}\\, dx + \\lim_{b\\to+\\infty } \\int_{0}^{b} \\frac{e^x}{1+e^{2x}}\\, dx.\n\\end{align*}\\] To do so we integrate \\(I = \\int \\frac{e^x}{1+e^{2x}}\\, dx.\\) Let \\(u=e^x\\), so that \\(du = e^x dx\\). Then we find \\[\\begin{equation}\nI = \\int \\frac{1}{1+u^2}\\, du = \\tan^{-1}u +C.\n\\end{equation}\\] Using this result we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{e^x}{1+e^{2x}}\\, dx\n& = \\lim_{a\\to-\\infty } \\left[\\tan^{-1} e^x\\right]_a^0 + \\lim_{b\\to+\\infty } \\left[\\tan^{-1} e^x\\right]_0^b \\\\\n& = \\lim_{a\\to-\\infty } \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} -\\tan^{-1}e^a \\right) + \\lim_{b\\to+\\infty } \\left[\\tan^{-1} e^b -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right]\n= \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n\\end{align*}\\] as desired.\n\n\nExample 44.5 Find the area of the region bounded by the graph of \\[\ny= \\frac{2}{x^2-2x+2}\n\\] and the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n\nSolution.

For example, the inﬁnite series \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ...\\) describes the sum of all natural numbers. So why are inﬁnite series important? Well, they pop up in a lot of places in mathematics, physics, and computer science.\nIn fact, inﬁnite series are so important that they have their own branch of mathematics devoted to them. So the next time you’re stuck trying to solve an inﬁnite series, just remember that you’re working on something that has puzzled mathematicians for centuries. And if that doesn’t make you feel better, at least you’re not alone.\nYou might be wondering, why would anyone want to add up an inﬁnite number of things? Well, in some cases, the answer is that we don’t actually have to add up all the terms in order to get a meaningful result.\nWhile inﬁnite series may seem like a theoretical concept, they actually have a wide range of applications in the real world. In fact, inﬁnite series are so important that they were once described as “one of the most useful and powerful tools ever invented by mathematicians.” So what makes inﬁnite series so special? Let’s take a closer look."

    "text": "45.2 Sequences\nIn mathematics, a sequence is an ordered set of terms. Sequences can be inﬁnite, in which case they are inﬁnitely long, or they can be ﬁnite, in which case they end after a certain number of terms. All the terms in a sequence are connected to each other and in order; there is no “jumping around” allowed!\nYou can think of a sequence as a list of numbers that might follow some kind of pattern. For example: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 is a sequence where each term is double the previous term. Another example is 3, 6, 9, 12, … , where each term is 3 more than the previous term.\nThere are many other types of patterns that sequences can follow. Some patterns are very simple and some are very complicated. You can even have sequences that go inﬁnitely long without repeating (like the decimal representation of 1/3 = 0.3333…). And some sequences repeat over and over again in a cycle (like 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1,…). As you can see, there’s a lot to explore with sequences!\nSequences can be found in nature, in art, and in many other places. The most famous sequence is probably the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two numbers in the series. However, there are many other interesting sequences out there.\nSequences can be used to model real-world situations, such as population growth or the spread of disease. They can also be used to solve problems, such as ﬁnding the area of a circle. In short, sequences are a powerful tool for understanding and solving problems in mathematics."

    "text": "45.3 Infinite Series and Convergence\nAn inﬁnite series is a sum of an inﬁnite sequence of numbers. In calculus, when studying inﬁnite series, one must ﬁrst understand whether an inﬁnite series will converge or diverge. To determine whether an inﬁnite series converges or diverges, one can use several methods such as the ratio test, the root test, or various comparison tests.\nIn general, if an inﬁnite series converges, then it is said to have a sum, whereas if an inﬁnite series diverges, then it is said to be unbound.\nFor example, the inﬁnite series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + … converges because each term in the sequence approaches 0 as n approaches inﬁnity. However, the inﬁnite series 1 + 2 + 3 + … diverges because it does not have a sum. In conclusion, understanding inﬁnite series and their convergence is important in calculus and other mathematical fields.\nThere are many different types of inﬁnite series, and the study of inﬁnite series is an active area of research in mathematics. In recent years, researchers have made significant progress in understanding the behavior of inﬁnite series and their applications to other areas of mathematics."

If the inﬁnite series converges, then the corresponding inﬁnite integral must also converge; if the inﬁnite series diverges, then the corresponding inﬁnite integral must also diverge.\nThe integral test is a test for inﬁnite series that uses integration to determine whether a given series converges or diverges. The test is based on the fact that if a function f is positive and increasing on the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\), then the inﬁnite series \\(\\sum f(n)\\) converges if and only if the inﬁnite integral \\(\\int f(x) dx\\) converges.\nIn other words, the integral test can be used to determine whether an inﬁnite series converges or diverges by first finding the corresponding integral and then checking to see if that integral converges or diverges.\nThe Integral Test is especially useful for inﬁnite series with non-negative terms, such as the p-Series.\nIn general, the p-Series is a series where each term is equal to \\(1/p^n\\), where \\(p\\) is a positive integer. The p-Series converges if \\(p > 1\\) and diverges if \\(p < 1\\). Thus, by the Integral Test, we can see that the p-Series will converge if and only if the corresponding inﬁnite integral converges."

    "text": "45.5 Infinite Series Test for Convergence\nWe all know the old saying, ``comparing apples and oranges.” But what about comparing series? In mathematics, a series is an inﬁnite sequence of terms, often resulting from the repeated addition of ﬁnite sequences. And just like apples and oranges, not all series are created equal.\nIn fact, there are an inﬁnite number of ways to compare two inﬁnite series. So which one is better? It all depends on your perspective. Here’s a look at some of the most popular methods of comparing series:\n\nThe ratio test: This method compares the inﬁnite sequences term by term. If the limit of the ratio between two terms is less than 1, then the inﬁnite series will converge; if the limit is greater than 1, then the inﬁnite series will diverge.\nThe root test: This method looks at the inﬁnite sequence of square roots. If the limit of the square root of a term is less than 1, then the inﬁnite series will converge; if the limit is greater than 1, then the inﬁnite series will diverge.\nThe comparison test: This method compares an inﬁnite series with another inﬁnite series that we already know converges or diverges. If the inﬁnite series being compared converges or diverges using the same criteria, then we can say that it has the same behavior as the other inﬁnite series.\n\nSo which method is best? That’s up for debate. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it really depends on your particular needs. In any case, there’s no need to worry about choosing the wrong method - with so many ways to compare inﬁnite series, you’re sure to find a technique that works for you!"

    "text": "45.6 Taylor Polynomials and Approximations\nA Taylor polynomial is an inﬁnite series that is used to approximate a function. The ﬁrst term in the series is the function itself, and each subsequent term is derived from the derivatives of the function at a certain point.\nThe degree of the polynomial corresponds to the number of derivatives that are used. For example, a first-degree polynomial uses one derivative, a second-degree polynomial uses two derivatives, and so on.\nTaylor polynomials are extremely useful in mathematics and physics because they allow us to approximate complicated functions using only a few terms. However, they are only approximations, so they are not always 100% accurate.\nIn general, higher-degree polynomials will be more accurate than lower-degree polynomials, but they will also be more difficult to work with. Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide which degree of approximation is appropriate for your needs."

Especially, when I learned about power series, Taylor series, and Maclaurin series in my calculus class. These mathematical concepts are used to approximate functions that can be difficult to work with directly. And while they may seem like a mouthful, they’re actually not that complicated.\nA power series is an inﬁnite series in which the terms are powers of a variable. For example, the series \\(x + x^2 + x^3 + · · ·\\) is a power series in which the terms are successive powers of x. A Taylor series is a power series that is used to approximate a function around a point. The Maclaurin series is just a special case of the Taylor series in which the point is 0. These concepts may seem like a lot to take in at first, but once you get the hang of them they’re actually quite simple. So if you ever ﬁnd yourself struggling with inﬁnite series, remember: there’s always a power in numbers."

For the first sequence, the denominators of the four known terms have been expressed as powers of 2. This suggests that the denominator of the \\(n\\)th term is \\(2^n\\). Thus, the sequence can be expressed as \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{16}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{2^n}, \\ldots\n\\] Notice that the second sequence has alternating signs and that notice that the \\(n\\)th term in the sequence can be obtained by multiplying the \\(n\\)th term by \\((-1)^{n+1}\\).

The numbers \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), are called the terms of the series; \\(a_n\\) is called the \\(n\\)th term, or general term, of the series; and the series itself is denoted by the symbol \\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n\n\\] or sometimes as \\(\\sum a_n\\).\n\n\nDefinition 47.2 Given an infinite series \\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n = a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots +a_n +\\cdots\n\\] the \\(n\\)th partial sum of the series is \\[\nS_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots+ a_n\n\\] If the sequence of partial sums \\(\\{S_n\\}\\) converges to the number \\(S\\), that is, if \\({\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} S_n =S}\\), then the series \\(\\sum a_n\\) converges and has sum \\(S\\), written \\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n = a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots +a_n +\\cdots =S.\n\\] If \\(\\{S_n\\}\\) diverges, then the series \\(\\sum a_n\\) diverges .\n\nFor example, the real number \\(1/7\\) can be approximated using a sequence of partial sums \\[\\begin{align*}\ns_1 & = 0.142857 = \\frac{142857}{10^6} \\\\\ns_2 & = s_1 + 0.000000142857 = \\frac{142857}{10^6} + \\frac{142857}{10^{12}}\\\\\ns_3 & = s_1 + s_2 + 0.000000000000142857 = \\frac{142857}{10^6} + \\frac{142857}{10^{12}} + \\frac{142857}{10^{18}} \\\\\n& \\vdots\n\\end{align*}\\] Notice that the \\(n\\)th partial sum is \\[\\begin{equation}\ns_n =  \\frac{142857}{10^6} + \\frac{142857}{10^{12}} + \\frac{142857}{10^{18}} + \\cdots + \\frac{142857}{10^{6n}}.\n\\label{nparsum}\n\\end{equation}\\] Therefore we find \\[\n\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} s_n\n= \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{142857}{10^6} + \\frac{142857}{10^{12}} + \\frac{142857}{10^{18}} + \\cdots + \\frac{142857}{10^{6n}}\\right).\n\\] To calculate this limit we need a closed form, so we multiple by sides of \\(\\eqref{nparsum}\\) by \\(1/10^6\\) and obtain \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{1}{10^{6}} s_n = \\frac{142857}{10^{12}} + \\frac{142857}{10^{18}} + \\frac{142857}{10^{24}} + \\cdots + \\frac{142857}{10^{6(n+1)}}.\n\\label{nparsumtwo}\n\\end{equation}\\] Now we subtract \\(\\eqref{nparsumtwo}\\) from \\(\\eqref{nparsum}\\) and obtain \\[\\begin{equation}\ns_n = \\frac{142857}{10^{6}} - \\frac{142857}{10^{6(n+1)}}\n= \\frac{142857}{10^{6}} \\left(1- \\frac{1}{10^{6n }}\\right).\n\\end{equation}\\] Whence \\[\n\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} s_n\n= \\lim_{n\\to \\infty}  \\frac{142857}{10^{6}} \\left(1- \\frac{1}{10^{6n }}\\right)\n=\n\\frac{1}{7}\n\\] as desired.\n\nExample 47.1 Show that the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{4}{4n^2-1}\\) is convergent, and find its sum.\n\n\nSolution.

    "section": "49.1 Direct Comparison Test",
    "text": "49.1 Direct Comparison Test\nThe idea behind the comparison tests is to determine whether a series converges or diverges by comparing a given series to an already familiar series. For example, the series \\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{e^n}\n\\] is known to converge. Do you think the similar series \\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{e^n+1}\n\\] also converges? The idea is compare each term, so that the sequence of partial sums can be compared also. Notice that \\[\n\\frac{1}{e^n+1} < \\frac{1}{e^n}.\n\\] This means that its partial sums must form a bounded increasing sequence, which as we know, is convergent.\n::: {#thm- } Suppose that \\(\\sum a_n\\) and \\(\\sum b_n\\) are series with positive terms. - If \\(\\sum b_n\\) is convergent and \\(a_n\\leq b_n\\) for all \\(n\\), then \\(\\sum a_n\\) is also convergent. - If \\(\\sum b_n\\) is divergent and \\(a_n \\geq b_n\\) for all \\(n\\), then \\(a_n\\) is also divergent. :::\n\nProof. For the first part, the partial sums of \\(\\sum a_n\\) are bounded above by \\[\nM =a_1+a_2+\\cdots +a_N +\\sum_{n=N+1}^\\infty c_n.\n\\] Therefore, the partial sums form a nondecreasing sequence with a limit \\(L\\) with \\(L\\leq M\\). For the second part, the partial sums of \\(\\sum a_n\\) are not bounded from above. Consider that if the partial sums of \\(\\sum a_n\\) are bounded above then the partial sums for \\(\\sum b_n\\) would be bounded by \\[\nM^* = b_1 +b_2 +\\cdots b_N +\\sum_{n=N+1}^\\infty a_n\n\\] and \\(\\sum b_n\\) would have to converge instead of diverge.\n\n\nExample 49.1 Determine if the series \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}-1}\\) is convergent or divergent.\n\n\nSolution. Let \\(a_n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n} -1}\\) and \\(b_n =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). Recall the series \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty b_n\\) is a divergent \\(p\\)-series. So by the Direct Comparison Test, with \\[\na_n =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n} -1} > \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} = b_n\n\\] we see that the given series is divergent.\n\n\nExample 49.2 Determine if the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{5}{2n^2+4n+3}\\) is convergent or divergent.\n\n\nSolution. Notice that for large \\(n\\) the term \\(2n^2\\) is dominate in the denominator. Observe that \\[\n\\frac{5}{2n^2+4n+3} < \\frac{5}{2n^2}\n\\] for all \\(n\\geq 1\\). Since we know that the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}\\) is convergent, so is the series \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}\\). Therefore the given series is convergent."

The Alternating Series Test is sometimes called Leibniz’s Theorem.\n::: {#thm- } An alternating series converges whenever the following conditions are satisfied\n\n\\(a_1 \\geq a_2 \\geq a_3 \\geq a_4 \\geq \\cdots \\geq a_n \\geq \\cdots\\)\n\\(\\lim_{n\\to +\\infty} a_n = 0\\) :::\n\n\nProof. Consider the following diagram. First we plot \\(s_1 = a_1\\). To find \\(s_2\\) we subtract \\(a_2\\), so \\(s_2\\) is to the left of \\(s_1\\). Then to find \\(s_3\\) we add \\(a_3\\), so \\(s_3\\) is to the right of \\(s_2\\). Since \\(a_3 < a_2\\), \\(s_3\\) is to the left of \\(s_1\\). Continuing in this pattern, we see that the partial sums oscillate back and forth. However, by the assumption \\(\\lim_{n\\to +\\infty} a_n = 0\\), the successive steps are becoming smaller and smaller.\nNotice that the odd partial sums \\(s_1, s_3, s_5, \\ldots\\) are decreasing and that the even partial sums \\(s_2, s_4, s_6, \\ldots\\) are increasing. We now consider the two cases.\nIf \\(n\\) is even, say \\(n=2m\\), then the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms is \\[\\begin{align*}\ns_{2m} & = (a_1-a_2) + (a_3-a_4) +\\cdots + (a_{2m-1}-a_{2m}) \\\\\n& = a_1-(a_2-a_3) - (a_4-a_5) - \\cdots  - (a_{2m-2}-a_{2m-1}) - a_{2m}\n\\end{align*}\\] Since each term in parentheses is positive or zero, we notice that \\(s_{2m}\\) is the sum of \\(m\\) nonnegative terms. Thus \\(s_{2m+2}\\geq s_{2m}\\), and the sequence \\(\\{s_{2m}\\}\\) is nondecreasing. Also notice that \\(s_{2m} \\leq a_1\\) and so the sequence \\(\\{s_{2m}\\}\\) is nondecreasing and bounded from above. Therefore, it has a limit, say \\[\n\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} s_{2m} = L.\n\\] Next we consider the subsequence of odd terms \\(\\{s_{2m+1}\\}\\) of \\(\\{s_n\\}\\). Since \\[\ns_{2m+1}= s_{2m}+a_{2m+1}\n\\]\nand \\(\\lim_{m\\to \\infty} a_{2m+1} = 0\\) by hypothesis, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{m\\to \\infty} s_{2m+1}\n& = \\lim_{m\\to \\infty} s_{2m}+a_{2m+1}\n= \\lim_{m\\to \\infty} s_{2m} +  \\lim_{m\\to \\infty} a_{2m+1}  = L\n\\end{align*}\\] Since the subsequence \\(\\{s_{2m+1}\\}\\) and \\(\\{s_{2m}\\}\\) of the sequence of partial sums \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) both converge to \\(L\\), we have \\(\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} s_n =L\\) as needed.\n\n\nExample 50.1 Show that the alternating harmonic series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}\\frac{1}{n}\\) converges or diverges.\n\n\nSolution. Notice that \\[\na_n =\\frac{1}{n} > \\frac{1}{n+1} = a_{n+1}\n\\] and that \\[\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}=0.\n\\] By the Alternating Series Test, the series must converge.\n\n\nExample 50.2 Show that the alternating harmonic series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}\\frac{n+1}{n}\\) converges or diverges.\n\n\nSolution. Notice that \\(a_{n+1}\\leq a_n\\), for all \\(n\\).

    "text": "54.2 Convergence of Taylor Series\nOur next result is often called Taylor’s Theorem and the remainder given in the theorem is called the Lagrange form of the remainder.\n\nTheorem 54.1  Let \\(f\\) have derivatives of order through \\(n+1\\) in an open interval \\(I\\) centered at \\(c\\), then, for each \\(x\\) in \\(I\\), there exists \\(z\\) between \\(x\\) and \\(c\\) such that \\[\nf(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^n \\frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!}(x-c)^n  + R_n(x)\n\\] where \\[\nR_n(x) = \\frac{f^{n+1}(z)}{(n+1)!} (x-c)^{n+1}.\n\\]\n\nGiven a function \\(f\\), we know how to write its Taylor series centered at a point \\(c\\), and we know how to find its interval of convergence. How do we know that the series actually converges to \\(f\\)? The remaining task is to determine when the Taylor series for \\(f\\) actually converges to \\(f\\) on its interval of convergence.\n\nTheorem 54.2  If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} R_n=0\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval \\(I\\), then the Taylor series for \\(f\\) converges and equals to \\(f(x)\\), \\[\nf(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!}(x-c)^n.\n\\]\n\n\nExample 54.5 Show that the Maclaurin series for \\(f(x)=e^x\\) converges to \\(f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\).\n\n\nSolution. The Maclaurin series for \\(e^x\\) is \\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}\n\\] which converges for all real numbers. The Taylor remainder is \\[\nR_n(x) = \\frac{e^z}{(n+1)!} x^{n+1}\n\\] for some \\(z\\) between \\(x\\) and \\(0\\). Thus \\[\n|R_n(x)| \\leq \\frac{e^{|x|}}{(n+1)!} |x|^{n+1}.\n\\] Therefore, for arbitrary \\(x\\) fixed, we find that \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left|R_n(x)\\right|\n= \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left|\\frac{e^c}{(n+1)!} x^{n+1}\\right|\n= 0\n\\end{align*}\\] By \\(\\ref{contay}\\), the Taylor series for \\(e^x\\) converges to \\(e^x\\).\n\n\nExample 54.6 Show that the Maclaurin series for \\(f(x)=\\sin x\\) converges to \\(f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\).\n\n\nSolution. The Maclaurin series for \\(\\sin x\\) is \\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^{n}\\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}\n\\] which converges for all real numbers. Notice that \\(f^{(n+1)}(z)=\\pm \\sin c\\) or \\(f^{(n+1)}(z)=\\pm \\cos z\\). In any case we have that \\(|f^{n+1}(z)|\\leq 1\\) for all real numbers \\(z\\). Thus \\[\n|R_n(x)| = \\frac{f^{(n+1)}(z)}{(n+1)!} |x|^{n+1}\n\\leq \\frac{|x|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}.\n\\] Therefore, for arbitrary \\(x\\) fixed, we find that \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left|R_n(x)\\right|\n= \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left|\\frac{|x|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\\right|\n= 0\n\\end{align*}\\] By \\(\\ref{contay}\\), the Taylor series for \\(\\sin x\\) converges to \\(\\sin x\\)."
