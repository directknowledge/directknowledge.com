After setting up a few configuration files (one-time only), I issue the command “quarto render” to build the static files. The website, books, blog(s), and slides are outputs from this building process. Math is displayed on the webpages using MathJax, Python runs in the browser using PyScript, and the pdfs are created using an installation of LaTeX in the background via Pandoc. These files are uploaded to a Github repository and then published using Netlify. I then use the ReavalJS slideshows to make YouTube videos. I have found that by using Visual Studio Code and Quarto together, this whole process takes place very quickly and is without cost.\n\nThese books, and their presentations, wouldn’t have been possible without those special individuals who offered their insight and guidance.

Of course, your mathematics should be accurate. This is not up for debate because mathematics that is not accurate is simply not mathematics. Even a slight exchange of words can lead to impotence or even nonsense. For example, consider the following variation of mathematical induction.\n\nIf \\(A\\) is a subset of the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) with the following two properties: \\(i\\)) 0 is in \\(A\\) and \\(ii\\)) for all \\(k\\) in \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), \\(k\\in A\\) implies \\(k+1\\in A\\), then \\(A\\) is the set of natural numbers.\n\nNow let’s switch two words and see what you think.\n\nIf \\(A\\) is the subset of the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) with the following two properties: \\(i\\)) 0 is in \\(A\\) and \\(ii\\)) for all \\(k\\) in \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), \\(k\\in A\\) implies \\(k+1\\in A\\), then \\(A\\) is a set of natural numbers.\n\nIn mathematics, precision is everything.
