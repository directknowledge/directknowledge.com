# Parametric Curves


Let $C$ be a curve defined by $P(t)=(f(t),g(t))$ where $f$ and $g$ are defined on the interval $I.$ The equations $x=f(t)$ and $y=g(t)$ for $t\in I$ are parametric equations for $C$ with parameter $t.$  The orientation of a parameterized curve $C$ is the direction determined by increasing values of the parameter.

(a) Sketch the graph of the curve $C_1: x=t, y=1-t$ on $[0,1]$ by plotting values for $t;$ and then check your graph by finding an equation in $x$ and $y$ only and then graphing. Show the orientation of the curve. 
(b) Sketch the graph of the curve   $C_2: x=1-t^2, y=t^2$ on $[0,1]$ by plotting values for $t;$ and then check your graph by finding an equation in $x$ and $y$ only and then graphing. Show the orientation of the curve. See Figure \ref{fig:p11}.
::: 
 
::: {.proof }[Solution] 
(a) The graph starts at the point $(0,1)$ and follows the line $y=1-x$ until it reaches the other endpoint at $(1,0).$ 
(b) The graph starts at the point $(1,0)$ and follows the line $x=1-y$ until it reaches the other endpoint at $(0,1).$ Comparing
(a) and (b) we see that the graph of a curve may have more than one parametrization. Can you think of another set of parametric equations that gives
the same graph?

Sketch the graph of the curve $C_3: x=\cos  2t, y=\sin  2t$ on $\left[0,\frac{\pi }{2}\right]$ by plotting values for $t;$ and then check your graph by finding an equation in $x$ and $y$ only and then graphing. Show the orientation of the curve. 
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution] 
The curve starts at $(1,0)$ and follows the upper part of the unit circle until it reaches the other endpoint of $(-1,0).$ $ $Can
you think of another set of parametric equations that give the same graph? See Figure \ref{fig:p12}.

(a) Find a rectangular equation whose graph contains the curve $C$ with the parametric equations $x=\frac{2t}{1+t^2}$ and $y=\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}$ and (b) Sketch the curve $C$ and indicate its orientation.
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution] 
Since 
\[
x^2+y^2=\frac{4t^2+(1-2t^2+t^4)}{(1+t^2)^2}=\frac{1+2t^2+t^4}{(1+t^2)^2}=1
\]
and also $x(0)=0$, $y(0)=0$ and $x(1/2)=4/5$, $y(1/2)=3/5$  we see the graph of the given parametric equations represents the unit circle with orientation counterclockwise.  See Figure \ref{fig:p13}.

The position of a particle at time $t$ is $(x,y)$ where $x=\sin t$ and $y=\sin^2 t$. Describe the motion of the particle as $t$ varies over the time interval $[a,b]$.
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution] 
We can eliminate $t$ to see that the motion of the object takes place on the parabola, $y=x^2$. The orientation of the curve is from $(\sin a, \sin^2 a)$ to $(\sin b, \sin^2 b)$. See Figure \ref{fig:p14}.

::: {#thm- } 
If $f'(t)$ is continuous and $f'(t)\neq 0$ for $a\leq t \leq b$, then the parametric curve defined by $x=f(t)$ and $y=g(t)$ for $a\leq t \leq b$, can be put into the form $y=F(x)$. Moreover, 
\[
F'(x)=\frac{g'(t)}{f'(t)} \quad \text{ and in Leibniz notation } \quad 
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{  \frac{dy}{dt}}{  \frac{dx}{dt}}
\]
whenever, $\frac{dx}{dt}\neq 0$. Also, if the parametric equations $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ define $y$ as a twice differentiable function over some suitable interval, then 
\[
\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}=\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)=\frac{  \frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{dy}{dx}\right)}{  \frac{dx}{dt}}.

Find the slope of the tangent line to the curve defined by the parametric equations $x=2(\theta-\sin \theta)$ and $y=2(1-\cos \theta)$ at the point corresponding to the value of the parameter $\theta=\pi/6$. 
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution] 
Since $\frac{dx}{d\theta}=2(1-\cos \theta)$ and $\frac{dy}{d\theta}=2\sin \theta$. The slope of the tangent line at $\theta=\pi/6$ is
\[
\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{\theta=\pi/6}=\left.\frac{dy/d\theta}{dx/d\theta}\right|_{\theta=\pi/6}=\left.\frac{2\sin \theta}{2(1-\cos \theta)}\right|_{\theta=\pi/6}=\frac{1}{2\left.(1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}=2+\sqrt{3}.
\]

::: {#exm- } 
Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve defined by the parametric equations $x=e^t$ and $y=e^{-t}$ at the point $(1,1)$. Then sketch the curve and the tangent line(s).
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution] 
Since $\frac{dx}{dt}=e^t$ and  $\frac{dy}{dt}=-e^{-t}$, 
\[
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}=\frac{-e^{-t}}{e^t}=-\frac{1}{e^{2t}}.
\]
The point $(1,1)$ corresponds to $t=0$. The slope of the tangent line is $\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{t=0}=-1$, so an equation is $y-1=-1(x-1)$ or just $-x+2$. See Figure \ref{fig:p15}.

Find the points on the curve defined by parametric equations $x=t^3-3t$ and $y=t^2$  at which the tangent line is either horizontal or vertical. Then sketch the curve. 
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution] 
First we find the derivatives of $x$ and $y$ with respect to $t$: $\frac{dx}{dt}=3t^2-3$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}=2t$. To find the point(s) where the tangent line is horizontal, set $\frac{dy}{dt}=0$ obtaining $t=0$. Since $\frac{dx}{dt} \neq 0$ 
at this $t$ value, the required point is $(0,0)$. To find the point(s) where the tangent line is vertical, set $\frac{dx}{dt}=0$ obtaining $t=\pm 1$. Since $\frac{dy}{dt}\neq 0$ at either of these $t$-values, the required points are $(2,1)$ and $(-2,1)$.

Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ given the parametric equations $x=\sqrt{t^2+1}$ and $y=t \ln t$. 
::: 

::: {.proof }[Solution] 
Since $\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{t}{\sqrt{t^2+1}}$ and  $\frac{dy}{dt}=1+\ln t$
\[
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{  dy/dt}{  dx/dt}=\frac{1+\ln t}{t/\sqrt{t^2+1}}=\frac{\sqrt{t^2+1}(1+\ln t)}{t}.
\]
Next, 
\begin{align*}
& \frac{d}{dt}\left[ \frac{(t^2+1)^{1/2}(1+\ln t)}{t}\right] \\
& \qquad = \frac{t\left[ \frac{1}{2} (t^2+1)^{-1/2} (2t) (1+\ln t)+\frac{  \left( t^2+1\right)^{1/2}}{t}\right]-(t^2+1)^{1/2}(1+\ln t)}{t^2} \\
& \qquad =\frac{  \frac{t^2(1+\ln t)}{(t^2+1)^{1/2}}+(t^2+1)^{1/2}-(t^2+1)^{1/2}(1+\ln t)}{t^2} \\
& \qquad = \frac{  \frac{t^2(1+\ln t)}{(t^2+1)^{1/2}}+\frac{t^2+1}{(t^2+1)^{1/2}}-\frac{(t^2+1)(1+\ln t)}{(t^2+1)^{1/2}}}{t^2} \\
& \qquad = \frac{t^2+t^2\ln t+t^2+1-t^2-t^2\ln t-1-\ln t}{t^2(t^2+1)^{1/2}} \\
& \qquad  = \frac{t^2-\ln t}{t^2\sqrt{t^2+1}} 
  \end{align*}
and so 
\[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=\frac{  \frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{dy}{dx}\right)}{  \frac{dx}{dt}} = \frac{t^2-\ln t}{t^2\sqrt{t^2+1}}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{t^2+1}}{t}=\frac{t^2-\ln t}{t^3}.

Show that the curve defined by parametric equations $x=t^2$ and $y=t^3-3t$ crosses itself. Find equations of the tangent lines to the curve at that point.

::: {.proof }[Solution] 
Observe that the curve is at the point $(3,0)$ when $t_1=-\sqrt{3}$ and $t_2=\sqrt{3}$, so the curve crosses itself at the point $(3,0)$. Since $\frac{dx}{dt}=3t^2-3$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{3(t^2-1)}{2t}$, at the first point of intersection, $m_1=\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{t=-\sqrt{3}}=\frac{3(3-1)}{2(-\sqrt{3})}=-\sqrt{3}$ and an equation of the tangent line is $y-0=-\sqrt{3}(x-3)$ or $y=-\sqrt{3}(x-3)$. At the second point, $m_2=\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{t=\sqrt{3}}=\frac{3(3-1)}{2(\sqrt{3})}=\sqrt{3}$ and an equation of the tangent line is $y-0=\sqrt{3}(x-3)$ or $y=\sqrt{3}(x-3)$.
