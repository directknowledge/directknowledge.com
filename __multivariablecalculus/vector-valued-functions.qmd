# Vector-valued Functions


Vector-valued functions are functions that assign a vector to every point in a given space. In this book, we will explore the properties of these functions and how they can be used to model real-world situations. We'll start with the basics and work our way up to more complex concepts. Along the way, you'll learn about space curves and how to calculate their derivatives and integrals. So whether you're a beginner or a pro, this book has something for you!

## What are vector-valued functions?

A vector function (or a, vector-valued function) is a function that takes one or more inputs and outputs a vector. Vector functions have a wide range of applications in science and technology.

Vector functions are important in mathematics, physics, and engineering. In physics, vector functions are used to describe the motion of particles and the behavior of waves. In engineering, vector functions are used to design bridges, buildings, and other structures. And in mathematics, vector functions are used to study geometry and topology.

## Vector-Valued Functions

Vector functionsÂ are quite interesting once you wrap your head around them. So let's take a few minutes to do just that.

A vector function is simply a function that takes one or more scalars as input and outputs a vector. In other words, it's a function that gives you a vector when you plug in a number(s). For example, the function $f(x) = (2x, 3x-1)$ is a vector function. You can think of it as a machine that takes in a number (x) and spits out a vector (2x, 3x-1). Pretty simple, right?

Now, vector functions can be used to model all sorts of things in the real world, from the trajectory of a baseball to the movement of particles in a fluid. So the next time you're struggling with a vector function problem, just remember that you're really just trying to understand the movement of something in the world around us. And that's not so tough after all.

## Derivatives and Integrals of Vector Functions

Derivatives and integrals of vector functions may sound like a mouthful, but they're really just mathematical tools that allow us to use vector functions. In other words, they let us find out how vector functions change over time or space. And that can be really useful information, whether we're trying to figure out the trajectory of a projectile or the motion of a planet in orbit.

So what exactly are derivatives and integrals of vector functions? Well, derivatives tell us how vector functions change with respect to changes in their input variables, while integrals give us information about how vector functions change over time or space. Basically, they're two sides of the same coin: one tells us how a vector function changes in response to changes in its input variables, while the other tells us how a vector function changes over time or space. But together, they give us a pretty complete picture of how vector functions behave.

## Applications of vector-valued functions in the real world

Vector functions are used in a variety of fields, such as physics, engineering, and economics. One example of their use is in the analysis of electrical circuits. Vector-valued functions can be used to model the voltage and current in an electrical circuit. This information can then be used to design products that are more efficient and have fewer problems.

In addition, vector-valued functions can be used to model the movement of objects in space. This information can be used to optimize the trajectory of a spacecraft or to predict the path of a hurricane. As you can see, vector-valued functions have a wide range of applications in the real world.

## Arc Length

There's more to a curve than meets the eye. In fact, one of the most important properties of a curve is its arc length. Arc length is simply the length of the curve between two points, and it can be calculated using vector functions.

Of course, this assumes that you have a vector function for your curve. If you don't, you could always try finding one. In any case, arc length is a vital property of curves, and it's something that everyone should know about.

It's a well-known fact that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But what if those points are moving? This is where the concept of arc length comes in. Arc length is simply the distance traveled by a point moving along a curve. In other terms, it's the length of a vector function. And just like with regular old straight-line distances, we can use arc length to calculate things like speed and acceleration.

So the next time you find yourself on a winding road, take comfort in knowing that you're traveling the mathematically shortest distance possible!

## Curvature

Curvature is a measure of how vector functions change as you move along them. In other words, it's a way to quantify how "curved" a function is. For example, the function $f(x) = x^2$ is more curved than the function $g(x) = x$. In this chapter, you'll learn how to find the ``curvature vector". This vector tells you how quickly the direction of the vector function is changing at any given point. It also tells you which way the vector function is curving - whether it's curving to the left or right. Curvature can be positive or negative, depending on which way the vector function is curving.

And finally, the curvature can be calculated for any (smooth) vector function - not just those that represent curves in two-dimensional space.

## Who is this book for?

This book is for anyone who wants to learn about vector-valued functions and their applications. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just someone curious about the topic, this book will give you a thorough understanding of vector-valued functions. We'll start with the basics and work our way up to more advanced material:

 
- What are vector-valued functions and what do they do?
- How are vector-valued functions used in the real world?
- What is arc length and how can it be calculated?
- What is curvature and how can it be calculated?
 

## How I teach in this book

In this book, you'll find short, concise chapters that get straight to the point. I'll also be using a lot of pictures and diagrams to help you understand the material. And finally, I'll be giving you plenty of opportunities to practice what you've learned with lots of exercises.

In general, the best way I teach vector functions is to start with simple examples and then gradually increase the complexity of the examples. This gives you a chance to learn the basics and solidify your understanding of the material before being overwhelmed by too much information at once.

So if you're ready to learn about vector-valued functions, then let's get started!



## Space Curves

Before we prove any theorems and develop any definitions let's see how natural it is to use vector functions to model the world around us. 

In the professor's classroom, there is little to no air movement so we  assume the only force acting on the arrow is gravity. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.75in]{_includes/flaming-arrow-pics.pdf}
\end{center}

::: {#exm- } 
To start a calculus semester a professor wants to light a torch with a flaming arrow that sits on top of a podium on the other side of a large classroom. 
::: 

::: {.solution }
Suppose the professor lit the arrow and shot it at a height of 6 ft above the ground level 90 ft from the 30 ft high podium and he wanted the arrow to reach a maximum height exactly 4 ft above the center of the podium. 
What will the initial firing angle of the arrow be?

Assume that the arrow is fired from the initial point $(x_0,y_0)=(0,6)$ corresponding to $t=0$. 
Using the definition of sine and cosine the initial velocity is found to be
\begin{align*}
\vec{v}_0
& =\left(x_0 +\norm{\vec{v}_0} \cos \theta \right) \vec{i}+\left(y_0+\norm{\vec{v}_0} \sin \theta \right)\vec{j} \\
& =\norm{\vec{v}_0} \cos \theta \, \vec{i}+\left(6+\norm{\vec{v}_0} \sin \theta \right)\vec{j} 
\end{align*}
where $\theta$ is the angle that $\vec{v}_0$ makes with the horizontal. 
Recall Newton's second law of motion which says the the force acting on the projectile is equal to the projectile's mass $m$ times its acceleration, or 
\[
\vec{F}=m \frac{d^2 \, \vec{r}}{d t^2}
\] 
when $\vec{r}$ is the projectile's position vector and $t$ is time. In the   
We assume the only force acting on the flaming arrow is the gravitational force $-m g \, \vec{j}$, then 
\begin{equation}
\label{fa1}
\frac{d^2 \, \vec{r}}{d t^2} = - g \, \vec{j}, 
\quad
\vec{r_0}=0\, \vec{i}+6\, \vec{j}, 
\quad \text{and} \quad  
\left.\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right|_{t=0}=\vec{v}_0.
\end{equation}
The first integration gives $\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}=-g t \, \vec{j}+\vec{v}_0$. The second integration yields
\begin{equation}\label{fa2}
\vec{r}(t)=\frac{-g t^2}{2}\, \vec{j} +\vec{v}_0 t+\vec{r}_0.
\end{equation}
Now using substitution of the initial conditions in \eqref{fa1} into equation \eqref{fa2} we find an expression for the position function of the arrow
\begin{equation}\label{fa3}
\vec{r}(t)=\left(\norm{\vec{v}_0} \cos\theta\right)t \, \vec{i}+\left(6+(\norm{\vec{v}_0}\sin \theta)t -\frac{1}{2} g t^2\right) \, \vec{j}.
\end{equation}
The arrow reaches its highest point when $\frac{dy}{dt}=0$, and solving for $t$ we obtain 
$$
t=\frac{\norm{\vec{v}_0} \sin \theta}{g}.
$$
For this value of $t$, the  value of $y$ is 
$$
6+\frac{ (\norm{\vec{v}_0} \sin \theta)^2 }{2g}.
$$
Using $y_{\text{max}}=34$ and $g=32$, we see that 
\[34=6+\frac{ (\norm{\vec{v}_0} \sin \theta)^2 }{2(32)}\] or $\norm{\vec{v}_0} \sin \theta =\sqrt{(28)(64)}$. 

In order to find $\theta$ we wish to find a similar expression for $\norm{\vec{v}_0} \cos \theta$. When the arrow reaches $y_{\text{max}}=34$, the horizontal distance is $x=90$ ft and by substitution into equation \eqref{fa3} we obtain 
\[90=(\norm{\vec{v}_0} \cos \theta) \left(\frac{\norm{\vec{v}_0} \sin \theta}{g}\right).\] Therefore we find 
\[
\tan \theta =\frac{\norm{\vec{v}_0} \sin \theta}{\norm{\vec{v}_0} \cos \theta} = \frac{\left(\sqrt{(28)(64)}\right)^2}{(90)(32)}=\frac{28}{45}.
\]
So the approximate firing angle will be 
\begin{equation}
\theta = \tan^{-1}(28/45) \approx 31.8908^\circ.
\end{equation}

## Definition of a Vector-Valued Function

Vector functions can be used to model the motion of an object. For example, suppose a fly takes off from the top of a coffee cup at the front of a classroom. The path the fly traces as it travels through the classroom is a one-dimensional path which can be described as a vector-valued function. You may want to study the path (geometry only), but you may also want to know its speed,
direction of motion, and acceleration at each point in time, in that case you will want more than its path -- you will want a vector-valued function that describes this fly's motion in three dimensions. Given a vector-valued function defined at each point in time, you will not only have position but also its speed, direction of motion, and acceleration at each point in time. 

A vector-valued function can be defined with more than one variable and with more components. In general, a vector-valued function is a function that takes an $n$-tuple of variables and outputs a unique vector with $m$ components. We start of by defining a vector function of one variable and then give several examples.


::: {#def- } 
A \index{vector-valued function} $\vec{F}$ of a real variable $t$ with \index{domain} $D$ assigns to each number $t$ in the set $D$ a unique vector $\vec{F} **vector-valued function} $\vec{F}$ of a real variable $t$ with \index{domain} $D$ assigns to each number $t$ in the set $D$ a unique vector $\vec{F** (t)$. The set of all vectors $\vec v$ of the form 
$\vec v=\vec{F}(t)$ for $t$ in $D$ is the \index{range} **range**  of $\vec F$.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=2in]{_includes/three-dimensions-pics.pdf}
\caption{We will often sketch the graph of a vector function in three dimensions.}
\label{fig:vfthree}
\end{figure} 

In three dimensions vector functions can be expressed in the form  
\[
\vec{F}(t)=f_1(t)\vec{i}+f_2(t)\vec{j}+f_3(t)\vec{k}
\]
where $f_1,f_2,$ and $f_3$ are real-valued functions of the real variable $t$ defined on the domain set $D$. 
A vector function may also be denoted by 
\[\vec{F}(t)= \langle f_1(t),f_2(t),f_3(t)\rangle .\] 
Unless stated otherwise, the \index{domain} of a vector function $\vec{F} **domain} of a vector function $\vec{F** $ is the intersection of the domains of the scalar component functions $f_1, f_2,$ and $f_3.$

\caption{Vector functions can be used in $1, 2, 3$ or $n$-dimensions.}
\label{fig:vf3}
\end{figure}  

Next we take a given vector-valued function and explicitly say what the scalar component functions are and ascertain the domain.


::: {#exm- } 
Given the vector function 
$$
\vec{F}(t)= t^3\, \vec{i} +\ln (3-t)\, \vec{j}+\sqrt{t}\, \vec{k}
$$
find the component functions and the domain of $\vec{F}$, and then evaluate $\vec{F}$ at $t=1$.
::: 

::: {.solution }
The component functions are $f(t)=t^3,$ $g(t)=\ln (3-t),$  and  $h(t)=\sqrt{t}$  
where $\vec{F}(t)=f(t)\, \vec{i}+g(t)\, \vec{j}+h(t)\, \vec{k}.$ The domain of $\vec{F}(t)$ is the interval $[0,3)$ since $\sqrt{t}$ requires $t\geq 0$ and $\ln (3-t)$ requires
$t<3.$ We can evaluate the vector function $\vec{F}$ at $t=1$ as follows
$
\vec{F}(1)=f(1)\, \vec{i}+g(1)\, \vec{j}+h(1)\, \vec{k} =\vec{i}+\ln  2\, \vec{j}+\vec{k}.
$

## Graphs of Vector Functions

Vector functions are useful for tracing out graphs of curves and for describing motion along a path. Often the variable $t$ represents time and since each $\vec{F}(t)$ represents a vector, we have a position $(x,y,z)$ at time $t.$ That is to say, given a time value of 
$t$ we have a vector 
$
\vec{F}(t)= \langle f_1(t),f_2(t),f_3(t)\rangle
$ 
which represents a point $(x,y,z)$ where $x=f_1(t),$ 
$y=f_2(t)$, and $z=f_3(t)$. In this manner, we use arrowheads on the curve to indicate the curve's orientation by pointing in the direction of increasing values of $t.$ 

\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=350pt]{_includes/svvf.pdf}
\caption{Sketches of vector-valued functions.}
\label{fig-vvf}
\end{figure}

Sketching the graph a given vector function can be time-consuming, especially if we are given an unfamiliar function.  In the next example we notice that each scalar component function is linear and so claim that the vector function is linear in three dimensions. Thus graphing this vector function is easy; just pick any two points in the domain you wish, plot them and then draw a straight line.

## Spaces Curves and Parameterizations

It is important to realize that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between a one-dimensional graph in three dimensions and a vector function. 
That is to say a vector-valued function has a graph, and only one set of points in three dimensions is its graph. 
But a graph (set of points in three dimensions) can be represented by more than one functional rule. 
The classic two dimensional example is that of the unit circle, which can be parametrized as a vector-valued function by $\vec{F}(t)=\sin t\vec{i}+\cos t\vec{j}$ with $0\leq t<2\pi $; and can also be parametrized as a vector-valued function by $\vec{F}(t)=\sin (2t)\vec{i}+\cos (2t)\vec{j}$ with $0\leq t<\pi $. 
With both of these vector-valued functions we have the same graph: the unit circle. 
It is this relationship between algebra and geometry that make vector-valued functions extremely useful and important to study. 

Finding a functional rule for a vector function, from given geometrical information, can also be a challenging endeavor. 
In fact, given a geometrical object in three dimensions, there can be quite a few ways to represent that object using algebra. 
In short, parametrizing a geometrical object, even one as simple as the unit circle, can lead to many parametric representations and thus different vector functions.  

In the next few examples we illustrate two ways in which this process might be carried out. 
We are given a geometric object and asked to find a vector function, (find a parametrization), that represents the given object. 

There are many other ways to accomplish the task of introducing the variable $t$, e.g. try $x=2t$. 
What's interesting is that no matter how you introduce $t$ the vector function obtained will have the same graph. 


::: {#exm- } 
Find a vector-valued function $\vec{F}$ whose graph is the curve of intersection of the hemisphere $z=\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$ and the parabolic cylinder $y=x^2$.  
::: 

::: {.solution }
One way to accomplish the task is by letting $x=t.$ 
Then $y=t^2$ and
$$
z=\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}=\sqrt{1-t^2-t^4}. 
$$
Therefore 
\[
\vec{F}(t)=t \vec{i}+t^2\vec{j}+\sqrt{1-t^2-t^4}\vec{k}.
\] 
is a value-valued function for this intersection.
See \ref{fig:int1}, for a sketch of the intersecting hemisphere and cylinder. 
\begin{figure}[htb]

::: 

Try reworking this example with $x=2t$. and graph the resulting vector function. 


::: {#exm- } 
Find a vector-valued function $\vec{F}$ whose graph is the curve of intersection of the plane $2 x+y+3z=6$ and the plane $x-y-z=1.$  
::: 

::: {.solution }
One way to accomplish the task is by letting $x=t.$ Then to find relations for $y$ and $z$ we will solve the system  
\[  
\begin{cases}
t-y-z=1  \\
2t+y+3z=6. 
\end{cases}
\]   
Eliminating $y$ we have, $3t+2z=7$ and so $z=(7-3t)/2$. Solving the first for $y$ we find  
\[
y=t-1-z=t-1-\left(\frac{7-3t}{2}\right)=\frac{2t-2-7+3t}{2}=\frac{5t-9}{2}
\]
Therefore 
\begin{equation}
\label{vfplanes}
\vec{F}(t)=t \, \vec{i}+\frac{5t-9}{2}\vec{j}+\frac{7-3t}{2}\vec{k}.
\end{equation}
is a vector-valued function for this intersection.

## Operations with Vector Functions

Next we show how to perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, dot product and the cross product with vector functions. 

::: {#def- } 
\label{limdf}
Let $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{G}$ be vector-valued functions of the real variable $t$, and let $f(t)$ be a real-valued function. Then $\vec{F}+\vec{G},$ $\vec{F}-\vec{G},$ $f\vec{F},$ $\vec{F}\times \vec{G},$ and $\vec{F}\cdot \vec{G} $ are vector functions defined as follows  
\begin{multicols}{2}
 
- $(\vec{F}+\vec{G})(t)=\vec{F}(t)+\vec{G}(t)$
- $(f\vec{F})(t)=f(t)\vec{F}(t)$ 
- $(\vec{F}-\vec{G})(t)=\vec{F}(t)-\vec{G}(t)$
- $(\vec{F}\cdot \vec{G})(t)=\vec{F}(t)\cdot \vec{G}(t)$ 
- $(\vec{F}\times \vec{G})(t)=\vec{F}(t)\times \vec{G}(t)$ 
  
\end{multicols}
These operations are defined on the intersection of the domain of the vector-valued and real-valued functions that occur in the definitions, respectively.
::: 


::: {#exm- } 
Let $\vec F$, $\vec G$ , and $\vec H$  be the vector functions defined by 
\begin{align*}
\vec{F}(t)=(2t)\vec{i}-5\vec{j}+t^2\vec{k}, 
\quad \vec{G}(t)=(1-t)\vec{i}+\frac{1}{t}\vec{k}, 
\quad \vec{H}(t)=(\sin  t)\vec{i}+e^t\vec{j}.
\end{align*}
Find the vector functions 
 
- $\vec{F}(t)\times \vec{G}(t)$
- $2e^t\vec{F}(t)+t\vec{G}(t)+10\vec{H}(t)$
- $\vec{G}(t)\cdot [\vec{H}(t)\times \vec{F}(t)]$
 
::: 

::: {.solution }
 
- Using \ref{limdf}, we find
\begin{align*}
& 2e^t\vec{F}(t)+t\vec{G}(t)+10\vec{H}(t) \\
& \qquad =\left(4t e^t+t-t^2+10 \sin  t\right)\vec{i}+\left(2t^2e^t+1\right)\vec{k}.
\end{align*}
- Using the determinant formula for a cross product of vectors, we find 
\begin{align*}
\vec{F}(t)\times \vec{G}(t)  
& = \left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
 \vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k}  \\
 2 t & -5 & t^2  \\
 1-t & 0 & \frac{1}{t}

\right| \\
& =\left(\frac{-5}{t}\right)\vec{i}+\left(-t^3+t^2-2\right)\vec{j}+(-5t+5)\vec{k}. 
\end{align*}
- We find 
$$
\vec{G}(t)\cdot [\vec{H}(t)\times \vec{F}(t)] = (1-t)t^2e^t-\frac{2 t e^t+5\sin  t}{t}
$$ 
by using  
\begin{align*}
& \vec{G}(t)\cdot [\vec{H}(t)\times \vec{F}(t)] \\
& \quad =\left[(1-t)\vec{i}+\frac{1}{t}\vec{k}\right]\cdot  \left| 
\begin{array}{ccc}
 \vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k}  \\
 \sin  t & e^t & 0  \\
 2 t & -5 & t^2
\end{array}
\right|.

## Limits of Vector Functions

The idea is now to extend the notion of a limit of a one-variable function and continuity of a one-variable function to vector-valued functions by capitalizing on the properties of vector functions. 


::: {#def- } 
Suppose the components function $f_1$, $f_2$, and $f_3$ of the vector-valued function 
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}(t)=f_1(t)\vec{i}+f_2(t)\vec{j}+f_3(t)\vec{k}
\end{equation}
all have finite limits as $t\rightarrow t_0$, where $t_0$ is any real number or $\pm \infty $. Then the limit of $\vec{F}(t)$ as $t\rightarrow t_0$ is defined as the vector 
\[
\lim _{t\to  t_0}\vec{F}(t)=\left( \lim  _{t\to  t_0}f_1(t)\right)\vec{i}+\left(\lim  _{t\to  t_0}f_2(t)\right)\vec{j}+\left(\lim  _{t\to  t_0}f_3(t)\right)\vec{k}.
\]

If the vector-valued functions $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{G}$ are functions of a real variable  $t$ and $h(t)$ is a real-valued function such that all three functions have finite limits as $t\to  t_0$, then  
  
- $\lim _{t\to  t_0}[\vec{F}(t)+\vec{G}(t)]
=\lim _{t\to  t_0}\vec{F}(t)+\lim _{t\to  t_0}\vec{G}(t)$

::: {.proof }
Let $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{G}$ have (respectively) standard forms 
\begin{equation}
\label{stform}
\vec{F}(t)=f_1(t)\vec{i}+f_2(t)\vec{j}+f_3(t)\vec{k}
\qquad 
\vec{G}(t)=g_1(t)\vec{i}+g_2(t)\vec{j}+g_3(t)\vec{k}. 
\end{equation}
(i) Using \eqref{stform} we find,
\begin{align*}
& \lim _{t\to  t_0}[\vec{F}(t)+\vec{G}(t)] \\
& =
\left(\lim _{t\to  t_0}(f_1+g_1)(t)\right) \vec{i} +\left(\lim _{t\to  t_0}(f_2+g_2)(t)\right) \vec{j}+\left(\lim _{t\to  t_0}(f_3+g_3)(t)\right) \vec{k} \\
&= 
\lim _{t\to  t_0}[f_1(t)\vec{i}+f_2(t)\vec{j}+f_3(t)\vec{k} ]+\lim _{t\to  t_0}[g_1(t)\vec{i}+g_2(t)\vec{j}+g_3(t)\vec{k}] \\
& = \lim _{t\to  t_0}\vec{F}(t)+\lim _{t\to  t_0}\vec{G}(t)
\end{align*}
(iv) Again using \eqref{stform} we find,
\begin{align*}
\lim _{t\to  t_0}[\vec{F}(t)\cdot \vec{G}(t)] 
& = \lim _{t\to  t_0}[f_1(t)g_1(t)+f_2(t)g_2(t)+f_3(t)g_3(t)] \\
& = [f_1(t_0)g_1(t_0)+f_2(t_0)g_2(t_0)+f_3(t_0)g_3(t_0)]  \\
& = \vec{F}(t_0)\cdot \vec{G}(t_0) \\
& = \left[\lim _{t\to  t_0}\vec{F}(t)\right]\cdot \left[\lim _{t\to  t_0}\vec{G}(t)\right]

## Continuous Vector Functions

One of the reasons why vector-valued functions are so favorable is that it is easy to extend known results from functions of one-variable and results in two-dimensional space to results concerning vector functions of one-variable, or \index{space curves} **space curves** , that have graphs in 3 (or more) dimensions. Continuity of vector functions is one such example.

::: {#def- } 
\label{cont}
A vector-valued function $\vec F$ is \index{continuous} at $t_0$ means $t_0$ is in the domain of $\vec{F}$ and $\lim _{t\to  t_0}\vec{F}(t)=\vec{F}\left(t_0\right)$. Further, a vector function is \index{continuous on an interval} **continuous} at $t_0$ means $t_0$ is in the domain of $\vec{F}$ and $\lim _{t\to  t_0}\vec{F}(t)=\vec{F}\left(t_0\right)$. Further, a vector function is \index{continuous on an interval**  $I$ if it is continuous at every point in the interval. 
::: 

::: {#thm- } [Continuous Vector Functions] 
\label{vecfunccontthm}
A vector function is continuous at $a$ if and only if each of its component functions is continuous at $a$. 
::: 

::: {.proof }
Suppose that $\vec{F}$ is a vector function that is continuous at $a$.
Let 
$$
\vec{F}(t)=f_1(t)\vec{i}+f_1(2)\vec{j}+f_3(t)\vec{k}.
$$
Then we have 
\begin{align*}
\vec{F}(a)=\lim_{t\to a} \vec{F}(t)
& =\lim_{t\to a} \left[ f_1(t)\vec{i}+f_1(2)\vec{j}+f_3(t)\vec{k} \right] 
\\[5pt] 
& = \left(\lim_{t\to a} f_1(t)\right)\vec{i}+\left(\lim_{t\to a} f_2(t)\right)\vec{j}+\left(\lim_{t\to a} f_3(t)\right)\vec{k} 
%\\ & =f_1(a)\vec{i}+f_2(a)\vec{j}+f_3(a)\vec{k}
\end{align*}
Hence 
$$
\lim_{t\to a} f_1(t)=f_1(a), \quad 
\lim_{t\to a} f_2(t)=f_2(a), \quad 
\lim_{t\to a} f_3(t)=f_3(a). 
$$
Therefore, each of the component functions of $\vec{F}$ is continuous at $a$. 
The reminder of the proof is Exercise \ref{ex:vecfunccontthm}.

Determine where the vector-valued function \
\[
\vec{F}(t)=t e^t \vec{i}+\frac{e^t}{t}\vec{j}+3e^t\vec{k}
\] 
is continuous. 
::: 

::: {.solution }
The component functions $t e^t$ and $3e^t$ are continuous for all real numbers. The component function $e^t/t$ is continuous on its domain. By \ref{vecfunccontthm}, the function $\vec{F}$ is continuous for all real numbers in its domain which is $\{t\in \mathbb{R}\, | \, t \neq 0\}.$  
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
Determine where the vector-valued function $\vec F$ defined by    
$$
\vec{F}(t)=\ds\frac{\vec{u}}{\|\vec{u}\|},   
\qquad 
\text{ }
\vec{u}=t\vec{i}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\vec{j}+e^t\vec{k}
$$ 
is continuous.  
::: 

::: {.solution }
By \ref{vecfunccontthm}, the function $\vec{F}$ is continuous for all real numbers in its domain which is $\{t\in \mathbb{R} \, : \, t>0\}$ because   
\[
\|\vec{u}\|= \sqrt{t^2+\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\right)^2+e^{2t}}
\] 
and therefore
\begin{align*}
\lim  _{t\to  t_0}\vec{F}(t) 
& =\lim  _{t\to  t_0}\left(\frac{t\vec{i}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\vec{j}+e^t\vec{k}}{\sqrt{t^2+\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\right)^2+e^{2t}}}\right)  
=\frac{t_0\vec{i}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{t_0}}\vec{j}+e^{t_0}\vec{k}}{\sqrt{\left(t_0\right)^2+\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t_0}}\right)^2+e^{2t_0}}}  
\\[5pt] 
&
=\left(\frac{t_0}{\sqrt{t_0^2+\frac{1}{t_0}+e^{2t_0}}}\right)\vec{i}+\left(\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{t_0}}}{\sqrt{t_0^2+\frac{1}{t_0}+e^{2t_0}}}\right)\vec{j}+\left(\frac{e^{t_0}}{\sqrt{t_0^2+\frac{1}{t_0}+e^{2t_0}}}\right)\vec{k}

for all real numbers such that $t_0>0.$
