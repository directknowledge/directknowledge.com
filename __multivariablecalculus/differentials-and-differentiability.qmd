# Differentials and Differentiability




## Differentials

::: {#def- } 
Let $z=f(x,y)$ and let  $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ be increments of $x$ and $y$, respectively. 
The \index{differentials} **differentials**  $dx$ and $dy$ of the independent variables 
$x$ and $y$ are defined by $dx=\Delta x$ and $dy=\Delta y$.
The \index{differential} $d z$, also called the \index{total differential} **differential} $d z$, also called the \index{total differential** , is defined by
\[
d z=f_x(x,y)d x+f_y(x,y)d y
=\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}d x+\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}d y.
\]
::: 


::: {#thm- } 
If $f(x,y)$ and its partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ are defined on an open region $R$ containing the point $P\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ and both $f_x$ and $f_y$ are continuous at $P,$ then  
\[
\Delta  f=f\left(x_0+\Delta  x,y_0+\Delta  y\right)-f\left(x_0,y_0\right)\approx f_x\left(x_0,y_0\right)\Delta  x+f_y\left(x_0,y_0\right)\Delta y
\]
so that  
\begin{equation}
\label{linappform}
f\left(x_0+\Delta  x,y_0+\Delta  y\right)\approx f\left(x_0,y_0\right)+f_x\left(x_0,y_0\right)\Delta  x+f_y\left(x_0,y_0\right)\Delta y.
\end{equation}
::: 

::: {#exm- } 

If 
$$
z=f(x,y)=x^2+3x y-y^2,
$$ 
find the differential $d z.$ 
Further, if $x$ changes from $2$ to $2.05$ and $y$ changes from $3$ to $2.96$, compare the values of $\Delta  z$ and $d z.$ 
Which is easier to compute $\Delta  z$ or $d z$?
::: 

::: {.solution }
By definition
\[
d z=\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}d x+\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}d y=(2x+3y)d x+(3x-2y)d y.
\]
Putting $x=2$, $d x=\Delta  x=0.05$, $y=3$, and $d y=\Delta  y=-0.04$, we get 
\[
d z=[2(2)+3(3)]0.05+[3(2)-2(3)](-0.04)=0.65.
\]  
The increment of $z$ is 
\begin{align*}
\Delta  z & =f(2.05,2.96)-f(2,3) \\
& =\left[(2.05)^2+3(2.05)(2.96)-(2.96)^2\right]-\left[2^2+3(2)-3^2\right] 
 =0.6449.\end{align*}
Notice that $\Delta  z\approx  d z$ but $d z$ is easier to compute.
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
Use differentials to approximate the real number 
\[
\sqrt{9(1.95)^2+(8.1)^2}.
\]
::: 

::: {.solution }
Consider the function 
$$
z=f(x,y)=\sqrt{9x^2+y^2}
$$ 
and observe that we can easily calculate $f(2,8)=10.$ Therefore, we take $a=2,
b=8, d x=\Delta  x=-0.05,$ and $d y=\Delta  y=0.1$ in our linear approximation formula with the multivariate function $f(x,y),$ so 
$$
f(a+\Delta  x,b+\Delta  y)\approx f(a,b)+d z.
$$ 
Next we compute the partial derivatives 
\[
f_x(x,y)=\frac{9x}{\sqrt{9x^2+y^2}} \qquad \text{and} \qquad f_y(x,y)=\frac{y}{\sqrt{9x^2+y^2}}
\]
Now using \ref{linappform}
\begin{align*}
& \sqrt{9(1.95)^2+(8.1)^2}
 =f(1.95,8.1)
 \approx f(2,8)+d z \\
& =f(2,8)+f_x(2,8)d x+f_y(2,8)d y 
 =10+\frac{18}{10}(-0.05)+\frac{8}{10}(0.1) 
 =9.99\end{align*}
This approximation is accurate to two decimal places.
::: 

::: {#exm- } 
Use differentials to approximate the real number 
\[
8.94\sqrt{9.99-(1.01)^3}.
\]
::: 

::: {.solution }
Consider the multivariate function $z=f(w,x,y)=w\sqrt{x-y^3}$ 
and observe that we can easily calculate 
$$
f(9,10,1)=9\sqrt{10-1^3}=27.
$$ 
Therefore, we take $a=9,$ $ b=10,$ $ c=1,$ $ d w=\Delta  w=-0.06,$
$d x=\Delta  x=-0.01$ and $d y=\Delta  y=0.01$ in 
$$
f(a+\Delta  x,b+\Delta  y,c+\Delta  z)\approx f(a,b,c)+d z.
$$
We find the partial derivatives 
\[
f_w(w,x,y)=\sqrt{x-y^3},
\quad 
f_x(w,x,y)=\frac{w}{2 \sqrt{x-y^3}},
\quad 
f_y(w,x,y)=-\frac{3 w y^2}{2 \sqrt{x-y^3}}
\] 
Now using \ref{linappform}
\begin{align*}
& 8.94\sqrt{9.99-(1.01)^3} 
=f(8.94,9.99,1.01)
 \approx f(9,10,1)+d z \\
& \qquad =f(9,10,1)+f_w(9,10,1)d w+f_x(9,10,1)d x+f_y(9,10,1)d y \\
& \qquad =27+3(-0.06)+\frac{3}{2}(-0.01)+-\frac{9}{2}(0.01) 
 =26.75\overline{9}.\end{align*}
This approximation is accurate to two decimal places.

## Differentiability

For a function of two variables $z=f(x,y)$, if $x$ and $y$ are given increments $\Delta  x$ and $\Delta
y$ , then the corresponding increment of $z$ is 
\[
\Delta  z=f(x+\Delta  x,y+\Delta  y)-f(x,y).
\]

::: {#def- } 
If $z=f(x,y)$, then $f$ is \index{differentiable} **differentiable**  at $(a,b)$ provided $\Delta  z$ can be expressed in the form
\[
\Delta  z=f_x(a,b)\Delta  x+f_y(a,b)\Delta  y+\epsilon _1\Delta  x+\epsilon _2\Delta  y
\]
where $\epsilon _1\to 0$ and $\epsilon _2\to  0$ as $(\Delta  x,\Delta  y)\to (0,0).$ Additionally, $f(x,y)$ is said to be differentiable in the region $R$ of the plane if $f$ is differentiable at each point in $R$.
::: 

::: {#thm- } [Differentiability Implies Continuity]
\label{suffdiff}
Let $f$ be a function of two variables with $(a,b)$ in the domain of $f.$ 
 
- If $f$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$ it is also continuous at $(a,b)$. 
- If $f$ is a function of $x$ and $y$, and $f$, $f_x$, $f_y$ are continuous in a disk $D$ centered at $(a,b)$, then $f$ is differentiable at $(a,b).$ 
 
::: 

::: {.proof }
The proof is left to the reader.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics{_includes/tpex1.pdf}
\caption{The function defined by $f(x,y)=1$ whenever $x$ and $y$ are both positive and $f(x,y)=0$ otherwise, is not differentiable at $(0,0)$.}
\label{fig:tanplane-1}
\end{figure} 

::: {#exm- } 
Let $f$ be the function defined by 
\begin{equation}
\label{nondiffex}
f(x,y)=
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{ if } x>0 \text{ and } y>0  \\ 
0 & \text{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Show that the partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist at the origin, but $f$ is not differentiable there.
::: 

::: {.solution }
Since $f(0,0)=0$, we have 
\[
f_x(0,0)=\lim _{\Delta  x\to 0}\frac{f(0+\Delta  x,0)-f(0,0)}{\Delta  x}=0
\] 
and similarly $f_y(0,0)=0.$ Thus, the partial derivatives both exist at the origin. If $f(x,y)$ were differentiable at the origin, it would have to be continuous there. Thus, we can show that $f$ is not differentiable by showing that it is not continuous at $(0,0).$ Toward this end, note that 
\begin{equation}
\label{nondifflimex}
\lim _{(x,y)\to (0,0)} f(x,y)
\end{equation} 
is 1 along the line $y=x$ in the first quadrant but it is $0$ if the approach is along the $x$-axis. This means that the limit in \ref{nondifflimex} does not exist. Thus $f(x,y)$ is not differentiable at $(0,0)$. 

Therefore $f(x,y)$ is an example of a  \index{non-differentiable} **non-differentiable**  function for which $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist, or in other words, the word differentiable means more than just the partial derivatives exist because the existence of partial derivatives does not guarantees that a function is differentiable. 
::: 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics{_includes/tpex2.pdf}
\caption{The polynomial function $f(x,y)=x^2y+x y^3$ is differentiable everywhere.}
\label{fig:tanplane-1}
\end{figure} 

::: {#exm- } 

Show that $f(x,y)=x^2y+x y^3$ is differentiable for all $(x,y)$. 
::: 

::: {.solution }
We find the partial derivatives
\[
f_x(x,y)=\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(x^2y+x y^3\right)=2x y+y^3\]
and
\[
f_y(x,y)=\frac{\partial }{\partial  y}\left(x^2y+x y^3\right)=x^2+3x y^2.
\]
Because $f,$ $f_x$ and $f_y$ are all polynomials in $x$ and $y$ they are continuous throughout the plane. Therefore by \ref{suffdiff}, $f$ must be differentiable for all $x$ and $y.$
::: 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics{_includes/tpex3.pdf}
\caption{The rational function $f(x,y)=\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}$ is not differentiable at $(0,0)$.}

\end{figure} 

::: {#exm- } 
Determine whether the function 
$$
f(x,y)=\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}
$$ 
is differentiable at either $(0,0)$ or $(1,1).$
Explain why.
::: 

::: {.solution }
Since $(0,0)$ is not in the domain of $f$, $f$ is not continuous at  $(0,0)$, and thus not differentiable at $(0,0)$ by \ref{suffdiff}. 
To show that $f$ is differentiable at $(1,1)$ we compute the partial derivatives 
\[
f_x=\frac{-2 x^5 y+2 x y^3}{\left(x^4+y^2\right)^2} \quad \text{and} \quad f_y= \frac{x^6-x^2 y^2}{\left(x^4+y^2\right)^2}.
\]
Since these partial derivatives and $f$ are continuous on any open disk not containing $(0,0)$ we conclude that $f$ is differentiable at any point except 
$(0,0)$; and in particular at $(1,1).$ 
::: 

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics{_includes/tpex4.pdf}
\caption{The function $f(x,y)=\frac{2(x-1)(y-1)}{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}$ whenever $(x,y)\neq (0,0)$ and $f(x,y)=0$ otherwise,  is not differentiable at $(1,1)$.}
\label{fig:tanplane-1}
\end{figure} 

::: {#exm- } 
Determine whether the function defined by 
\[
f(x,y)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\frac{2(x-1)(y-1)}{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2} & \text{if } (x,y)\neq (0,0) \\[15pt] 0 & \text{if } (x,y)= (0,0)
\end{array}\right.
\]
is differentiable at either $(0,0)$ or $(1,1).$ Explain why.
::: 

::: {.solution }
The limit, 
\[
\lim_{(x,y)\to (1,1)}\frac{2(x-1)(y-1)}{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}
\] 
does not exist because along $y=1$
\[
\plim{(x,y)\to (1,1)}{y=1} \frac{2(x-1)(y-1)}{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}
=\lim_{x\to1}\frac{0}{(x-1)^2}
=0
\] 
and along $y=x$
\[
\plim{(x,y)\to (1,1)}{y=x} \frac{2(x-1)(y-1)}{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}
=\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{2(x-1)^2}{(x-1)^2+(x-1)^2}
=1.
\]  
Therefore $f$ is not continuous at $(1,1)$. By \ref{suffdiff}, $f$ is not differentiable at $(1,1).$ To show that $f$ is differentiable at $(0,0)$ we compute the partial derivatives,
\[
f_x(x,y)=
\frac{[(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2][2(y-1)]-[2(x-1)(y-1)][2(x-1)]}{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}
\quad \text{for $(x,y)\neq (0,0)$}
\]  
and
\[
f_y(x,y)=
\frac{[(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2][2(x-1)]-[2(x-1)(y-1)][2(y-1)]}{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}
\quad \text{for $(x,y)\neq (0,0)$}.
\]  
Since $f$, $f_x$ and  $f_y$ are rational functions they are continuous on any open disk not containing $(1,1)$. We conclude that $f$ is differentiable at any point except $(1,1)$; and in particular at $(0,0).$
