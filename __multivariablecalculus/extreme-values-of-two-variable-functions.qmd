# Extreme Values of Two Variable Functions




## Relative Extrema

::: {#def- } 

Let $f$ be a function of two variables $x$ and $y$.
 
- The function $f$ has a \index{relative maximum} **relative maximum**  at 
$\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ if $f(x,y)\leq f\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ for all $(x,y)$ in an open disk containing $\left(x_0,y_0\right)$. 
- The function $f$ has a \index{relative minimum} **relative minimum**  at 
$\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ if $f(x,y)\geq f\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ for all $(x,y)$ in an open disk containing 
$\left(x_0,y_0\right).$ 
 
Collectively, relative maxima and relative minima are called 
\index{relative extrema} **relative extrema** .
::: 

::: {#lem- } [Critical Points]

If $f$ has a relative extremum at $\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ and partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ both exist at $\left(x_0,y_0\right),$ then 
$$
f_x\left(x_0,y_0\right)=f_y\left(x_0,y_0\right)=0.
$$ 
::: 
 
::: {.proof }
Let $F(x)=f\left(x,y_0\right).$ Then $F(x)$ must have a relative extremum at $x=x_0,$ so $F'\left(x_0\right)=0,$ which means
that $f_x\left(x_0,y_0\right)=0.$ Similarly, $G(y)=f\left(x_0,y\right)$ has a relative extremum at $y=y_0,$ so $G'\left(y_0\right)=0$ and
$f_y\left(x_0,y_0\right)=0.$ Thus, we must have both $f_x\left(x_0,y_0\right)=0$ and $f_y\left(x_0,y_0\right)=0.$
::: 

::: {#def- } 
A \index{critical point} **critical point**  of a function $f$ defined on an open set $D$ is a point $\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ in $D$ where either
one of the following is true: 
 
- $f_x\left(x_0,y_0\right)=f_y\left(x_0,y_0\right)=0$ or 
- at least one of $f_x$ or $f_y$ does not exist at $\left(x_0,y_0\right).$

::: {#exm- } 
Find the critical points for the function 
\[
f(x,y)=x^2+y^2-2x-6y+14.
\]
::: 

::: {.solution }
The first partial derivatives of $f$ are
\[
f_x(x,y)=2x-2 \qquad 
\text{and} \qquad 
f_y(x,y)=2y-6.
\] 
These partial derivatives are equal to 0 when $x=1$ and $y=3$ so the only critical point is $(1,3).$ By completing the square we find that 
\[
f(x,y)=4+(x-1)^2+(y-3)^2.
\]  
Since $(x-1)^2\geq  0$ and $(y-3)^2\geq  0,$ we have $f(x,y)\geq 4$ for all values of $x$ and $y.$ Therefore, $f(1,3)=4$ is a local minimum, and in fact it is the absolute minimum of $f.$ This can be confirmed geometrically from the graph of $f$, which is the elliptic paraboloid with vertex $(1,3,4)$ as shown in \ref{fig:ext-func-1}.
::: 

::: {#def- } 
A critical point $P_0\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ is called a \index{saddle point} **saddle point**  of $f$ if every open disk centered at $P_0$ contains points in the domain of $f$ that satisfy $f(x,y)>f\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ as well as points in the domain of $f$ that satisfy $f(x,y)<f\left(x_0,y_0\right).$
::: 

\begin{figure}[htb]

\end{figure} 

::: {#exm- } 
Find the extreme values of 
$$
f(x,y)=y^2-x^2.
$$
::: 

::: {.solution }
Since $f_x=-2x$ and $f_y=2y,$ the only critical point is $(0,0).$ Notice that for points on the $x$-axis we have $y=0,$
so $f(x,0)=-x^2<0$ (if $x\neq 0.$) 
However for points on the $y$-axis we have $x=0,$ so $f(0,y)=y^2>0$ (if $y\neq 0$). 
Thus every disk with center $(0,0)$ contains points where $f$ takes positive values as well as points where $f$ takes negative values. 
Therefore $f(0,0)=0$ cannot be an extreme value for $f,$ so $f$ has no extreme values. 
\par
This example illustrates the fact that a function need not have a maximum or minimum value at a critical point. 
The graph of $f$ is the hyperbolic paraboloid which has a horizontal tangent plane $(z=0)$ at the origin. 
You can see that $f(0,0)=0$ is a maximum in the direction of the $x-\text{axis}$ but not in the direction of the $y$-axis. 
Near the origin the graph has the shape of a saddle as shown in \ref{fig:ext-func-2}.
::: 

::: {#thm- } [Second Partials Test]
\label{secondpartialstest}
Assume $f$ has a critical point at $P_0(x_0,y_0)$ and assume that $f$ has continuous second order partial derivatives in a disk centered at $\left(x_0,y_0\right).$ 
If $D:=(f_{x x}f_{y y}-\left(f_{x y}\right)^2)\left(x_0,y_0\right)>0$, then 
 
- a relative maximum occurs at $P_0$ if $f_{x x}\left(x_0,y_0\right)<0$
- a relative minimum occurs at $P_0$ if $f_{x x}\left(x_0,y_0\right)>0$. 
 
If $D\left(x_0,y_0\right)<0$, then a saddle point occurs at $P_0$.
::: 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics{_includes/extfunc3.pdf}
\caption{The graph of $f(x,y)=x^4+y^4-4x y+1$ has relative minimum at $(-1,-1)$ and $(1,1)$.}

\end{figure} 

::: {#exm- } 
Find the relative extrema of the function  
\[
f(x,y)=x^4+y^4-4x y+1.
\]
::: 

::: {.solution }
We first locate the critical points 
\[
f_x=4x^3-4y \qquad \text{and} \qquad f_y=4y^3-4x.
\]  
Setting these partial derivatives to 0, we obtain the equations$x^3-y=0$ and $y^3-x=0.$  
To solve these equations we substitute $y=x^3$ from the first equation into the second one. 
This gives 
\[
0
=x^9-x
=x\left(x^8-1\right) 
=x\left(x^4-1\right)\left(x^4+1\right) 
=x(x-1)(x+1)\left(x^2+1\right)\left(x^4+1\right)
\]
So there are three real roots: $x=0,1 ,-1.$ 
The three critical points are $(0,0), (1,1),$ and $(-1,-1).$ 
Next we calculate the second partial derivatives and $D(x,y)$: 
\[
f_{x x}=12x^2, \qquad f_{x y}=-4, \qquad f_{y y}=12y^2.
\] 
Thus, 
\[D(x,y)=f_{x x}f_{y y}-\left(f_{x y}\right)^2=144x^2y^2-16.
\] 
Since $D(0,0)=-16<0,$ it follows that the origin is a saddle point; that is, $f$ has no local extremum at $(0,0).$ 
Since $D(1,1)=128>0$ and $f_{x x}(1,1)=12>0,$ we see that $f(1,1)=-1$ is a local minimum. 
Similarly, we have $D(-1,-1)=128>0$ and $f_{x x}(-1,1-1)=12>0,$ so $f(-1,-1)=-1$ is also a local minimum.  
::: 




## Absolute Extrema

::: {#def- } 
Let $f$ be a function of two variables $x$ and $y$.
 
- The function $f$ has a \index{relative maximum} **relative maximum**  at 
$\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ if $f(x,y)\leq f\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ for all $(x,y)$ in the domain $D$ of $f$. 
- The function $f$ has a \index{relative minimum} **relative minimum**  at 
$\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ if $f(x,y)\geq f\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ for all $(x,y)$ in the domain $D$ of $f$.
 
Collectively, absolute maxima and absolute minima are called 
\index{absolute extrema} **absolute extrema** .
::: 

::: {#thm- } [Extreme Value]
A function $f$ attains both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum on any closed bounded
set $S$ where it is continuous. 
::: 

::: {.proof }
The proof is left for the reader.
::: 

\begin{figure}[htb]

::: {#exm- } 
Find the \index{shortest distance} **shortest distance**  from the point $(1,0,-2)$ to the plane 
$$
x+2y+z=4.
$$
::: 

::: {.solution }
The distance from any point $(x,y,z)$ to the point $(1,0,-2)$ is 
\[d=\sqrt{(x-1)^2+y^2+(z+2)^2}\] 
but if $(x,y,z)$ lies on the plane, then $z=4-x-2y$ and so we have 
\[d=\sqrt{(x-1)^2+y^2+(6-x-2y)^2}.\]
We can minimize $d$ by minimizing the simpler expression 
\[d^2=f(x,y)=(x-1)^2+y^2+(6-x-2y)^2.\]  
By solving the equations 
\[f_x=2(x-1)^2-2(6-x-2y)=4x+4y-14=0\]  
\[f_y=2y-4(6-x-2y)=4x+10y-24=0\] 
we find that the only critical point is $(11/3,5/3).$ Since $f_{x x}=4,$ $f_{x y}=4,$ and $f_{y y}=10,$ we have 
\[D(x,y)=f_{x x}f_{y y}-\left(f_{x y}\right){}^2=24>0\] 
and $f_{x x}>0$ so $f$ has a local minimum at $(11/6,5/3).$ Intuitively, we can see that this local minimum is actually
an absolute minimum because there must be a point on the given plane that is closest to $(1,0,-2).$ If $x=11/6$ and $y=5/3,$ then 
\[d=\sqrt{\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2+\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2+\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2}=\frac{5\sqrt{6}}{6}.\] 
which is the shortest distance.

$$
::: 

::: {.solution }
Since $f$ is a polynomial it is continuous on the closed bounded rectangle $D,$ therefore $f$ has both absolute maximum
and minimum values. We first find the critical points by solving the system 
\[f_x=2x-2y=0 \qquad \text{and} \qquad f_y=-2x+2=0\] 
The only critical point is $(1,1),$ and the value of $f$ there is $f(1,1)=1.$ We look at the values of $f$ on the boundary of $D$, which consists of four line segments $L_1, L_2, L_3$, and $L_4$ as follows.
\par
On $L_1$ we have $y=0$ and $f(x,0)=x^2$ for $0\leq x\leq 3.$ This is an increasing function of $x,$ so its minimum value is $f(0,0)=0$ and its maximum value is $f(3,0)=9.$ 
\par
On $L_2$ we have $x=3$ and $f(3,y)=9-4y$ on $0\leq y\leq 2.$ This is a decreasing function of $y,$ so its maximum value is $f(3,0)=9$ and its minimum value is $f(3,2)=1.$ 
\par
On $L_3$ we have $y=2$ and $f(x,2)=x^2-4x+4$ on $0\leq x\leq 3.$ By observing that $f(x,2)=(x-2)^2,$ we see that the minimum value of this function is $f(2,2)=0$ and the maximum value is $f(0,2)=4.$ 
\par
On $L_4$ we have $x=0$ and $f(0,y)=2y$ on $0\leq y\leq 2$ with maximum value $f(0,2)=4$ and minimum value $f(0,0)=0.$ 
\par
Thus on the boundary, the minimum value of $f$ is 0 and the maximum is 9. 
We compare these values with the value $f(1,1)=1$ at the critical point and conclude that the absolute maximum value of $f$ on $D$ is $f(3,0)=9$ and the absolute minimum value is $f(0,0)=f(2,2)=0.$

A rectangular box without a lid is to be made from 12 $m^2$ of cardboard. 
Find the maximum volume of such a box.
::: 

::: {.solution }
Let the length, width, and height of the box (in meters) be $x,$ $y,$ and $z.$ 
Then the volume of the box is $V=x y z.$ We can express $V$ as a function of just two variables by using the fact that the surface area of the sides and the bottom of the box is $2x z+2 y z+x y=12.$ 
Solving these equation for $z,$ we get 
\[
z=\frac{12-x y}{2(x+y)},
\] 
so the expression for volume $V$ becomes 
\[
V=\frac{12 x y-x^2y^2}{2(x+y)}.
\] 
We compute the partial derivatives
\[
V_x=\frac{y^2\left(12-2 x y-x^2\right)}{2(x+y)}
\qquad \text{and}\qquad 
V_y=\frac{x^2\left(12-2 x y -y^2\right)}{2(x+y)^2}.
\]
If $V$ is a maximum, then $V_x=V_y=0,$ but $x=0$ or $y=0$ gives $V=0,$ so we must solve the equations
\[
12-2x y-x^2=0\qquad \text{and} \qquad 
12-2 x y-y^2=0.
\] 
These imply that $x^2=y^2$ and so $x=y$. (Note that $x$ and $y$ must both be positive in this example.) 
If we put $x=y$ in either equation we get $12-3x^2=0,$ which gives $x=2,$ $y=2,$ and $z=1.$ 
From the physical nature of this example there must be an absolute maximum volume that has to occur at a critical point of $V,$ so it must be when $x=2,$ $y=2,$ and $z=1.$ 
Then $V=2\cdot 2\cdot 1=4,$ so the maximum volume of the box is $4m^3.$

::: {.solution }
We compute $f_x=2x-4$ and $f_y=6y+2$ and set $f_x=f_y=0$ and find that $(2,-1/3)$ is the only critical point in the interior.
On $x=t, y=0$ for $0\leq t\leq 3$, we have 
$$
F_1(t)=f(t,0)=t^2-4t-3=0
$$ 
and so $F_1'(t)=2t-4$ yielding the point $(2,0).$ 
On $x=3, y=t$ for $-3\leq t\leq 0$, we have 
$$
F_2(t)=f(3,t)=3t^2+2t-6
$$ 
and so $F_2'(t)=6t+2=0$ yielding the point $(3,-1/3).$ 
On $x=t, y=-3$ for $0\leq t\leq 3$, we have  
$$
F_3(t)=f(t,-3)=t^2-4t+18
$$ 
and so $F_3'(t)=2t-4=0$ yielding the point $(2,-3).$ 
On $x=0, y=t$ for $-3\leq t\leq 0$, we have 
$$
F_4'(t)=f(0,t)=3t^2+2t-3

and so $F_4'(t)=6t+2=0$ yielding the point $(0,-1/3).$ 
\par
Finally, we have $f(2,-1/3)=-22/3$ (the minimum), $f(3,-1/3)=-19/3,$ $f(2,-3)=14,$
$f(0,-1/3)=-10/3,$ $f(2,0)=-7,$ $f(0,0)=-3,$ $f(3,0)=-6,$ $f(3,-3)=15,$ and $f(0,-3)=18$ (the maximum).

::: 
 
::: {.proof }[Solution] 
 Since $f$ is continuous and $R$ is closed and bounded, we know that the absolute maximum and minimum exist. We find that
 $$
 \nabla f=\cos  x \vec{i}+(-2\sin  2y)\vec{j}
 $$ 
 and so the only critical point in the interior of $R$ is $(\pi /2,\pi /2).$
 This is a saddle point because the discriminant of $f$ at $(\pi 2,\pi /2)$ is negative. 
The boundary of $R$ consists of four line segments $L_1,$ $L_2,$ $L_3,$ and $L_4$ as follows. 
\par
On $L_1$ and $L_3,$ we have 
$$
f(x,0)=f(x,\pi) =\sin x+1
\quad \text{ for } 0\leq x\leq  \pi
$$ 
which achieves a maximum at $\pi /2$ and a minimum at $0$ and $\pi .$ 
Similarly, on $L_2$ and $L_4$ we have 
$$
f(0,y)=f(\pi ,y) =\cos 2y
\quad \text{ for } 0\leq y\leq  \pi
$$
which achieves its maximum at $0$ and $\pi $ and its minimum at $\pi /2.$ 
We see that the hottest points are $(\pi /2,0)$ and $(\pi /2,\pi )$ and the coldest points are $(0,\pi /2)$ and $(\pi ,\pi /2).$
