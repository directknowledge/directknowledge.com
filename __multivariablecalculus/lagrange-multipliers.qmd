# Lagrange Multipliers


In many applied problems, the main focus is on optimizing a function subject to constraint; for example, finding extreme values of a function of several variables where the domain is restricted to a level
curve (or surface) of another function of several variables. 
\index{Lagrange multipliers} **Lagrange multipliers**  are a general method which can be used to solve such optimization problems. 

## Lagrange's Theorem


The $\lambda$ in \ref{lagthm} is called a \index{Lagrange multiplier.} **Lagrange multiplier.** 
Thus, Lagrange's Theorem gives necessary conditions for the existence of a Lagrange multiplier. 

::: {#thm- } [Lagrange]
\label{lagthm}

Assume that $f$ and $g$ have continuous first partial derivatives and that $f$ has an extremum at $P_0\left(x_0,y_0\right)$
on the smooth constraint curve $g(x,y)=c.$ If $\nabla g\left(x_0,y_0\right)\neq \vec{0},$ there is a number $\lambda $ such that 
\begin{equation}
\label{lagmult}
\nabla f\left(x_0,y_0\right)=\lambda \nabla g\left(x_0,y_0\right).
\end{equation}
::: 
 
::: {.proof }
Denote the constraint curve $g(x,y)=c$ by $C$ and note that $C$ is smooth. 
We represent this curve by the vector function 
$$
\vec{R}(t)=x(t)\vec{i}+y(t)\vec{j}
$$ 
for all $t$ in an open interval $I,$ including $t_0$ corresponding to $P_0,$ where $x'(t)$ and $y'(t)$ exist and are continuous. 
Let $F(t)=f(x(t),y(t))$ for all $t$ in $I,$ and apply the chain rule to obtain 
$$
F'(t)=f_x(x(t),y(t))\frac{d x}{d t}+f_y(x(t),y(t))\frac{d y}{d t}=\nabla f(x(t),y(t))\cdot \vec{R}'(t).
$$
Because $f(x,y)$ has an extremum at $P_0,$ we know that $F(t)$ has an extremum at $t_0.$ 
Therefore, we have 
$F'\left(t_0\right)=0$ and
$$
F'\left(t_0\right)=\nabla f\left(x\left(t_0\right),y\left(t_0\right)\right)\cdot \vec{R}'\left(t_0\right)=0.
$$
If $\nabla f\left(x\left(t_0\right),y\left(t_0\right)\right)=\vec{0},$ then $\lambda =0,$ and the condition $\nabla f=\lambda \nabla g$ is satisfied trivially. 
If $\nabla f\left(x\left(t_0\right),y\left(t_0\right)\right)\neq \vec{0}$, then $\nabla f\left(x\left(t_0\right),y\left(t_0\right)\right)$ is orthogonal to $\vec{R}'\left(t_0\right).$ 
Because $\vec{R}'\left(t_0\right)$ is tangent to the constraint curve $C$, it follows that $\nabla f\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ is normal to $C.$ 
But $\nabla g\left(x\left(t_0\right),y\left(t_0\right)\right)$ is also normal to $C$ (because $C$ is a level curve of $g$), and we conclude that $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$ must be parallel at $P_0.$ 
Thus, there is a scalar $\lambda$ such that \ref{lagmult} holds.

::: {#exm- } 
Find the extreme values of the function $f(x,y)=x^2+y$ constrained to the circle $x^2+y^2=1.$
::: 

::: {.solution }
Using \ref{lagthm}, we solve the equations $\nabla f=\lambda \nabla g,$ $g(x,y)=1,$ which can be written as $f_x=\lambda g_x,$ $f_y=\lambda g_y$, and $g(x,y)=1$ or written as 
\[
 2x=2x \lambda, \qquad 1=2y \lambda, \qquad \text{and}  \qquad x^2+y^2=1.
 \]
From the first equation we have $x=0$ or $\lambda =1.$ If $x=0,$ then by the third equation $y=\pm 1.$ If $\lambda =1,$ then $y=1/2$
and we obtain $x=\left.\pm \sqrt{3}\right/2.$ Therefore, $f$ has possible extreme values at the points 
\[
(0,1),  \qquad (0,-1), \qquad \left(\left.\sqrt{3}\right/2,1/2\right),  \qquad
\text{and} \qquad \left(\left.-\sqrt{3}\right/2,1/2\right).
\] 
Evaluating $f$ at these four points, we find that 
\[
f(0,1)=1, \qquad f(0,-1)=-1, \qquad \text{and} \qquad f\left(\left.\pm \sqrt{3}\right/2,1/2\right)=5/4.\]
Therefore the maximum value of $f$ constrained to the circle $x^2+y^2=1$ is $5/4$ and the minimum value is $-1.$

## The Method of Lagrange Multipliers

::: {#thm- } [Lagrange Multipliers]

Suppose $f$ and $g$ satisfy the hypotheses of Lagrange's theorem, and that $f$ has an extremum subject to the constraint $g(x,y)=c.$
Then to find the extreme value, proceed as follows: 
 
- Simultaneously solve the following three equations for $x,y$ and 
$\lambda$: 
\[
f_x(x,y)=\lambda g_x(x,y), \quad f_y(x,y)=\lambda g_y(x,y),
\quad  \text{and} \quad g(x,y)=c
\]
- Evaluate $f$ at all points found in step (i). 
The extremum we seek must be among these values.

%\begin{comment}
We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the required constrained extrema. 
Suppose $E$ is an extreme value of $f$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y)=c.$ Then the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda $ is the rate of change of $E$ with respect to $c$; that is $\lambda =d E/d c.$ Note that at the extreme value $(x,y)$ we have $f_x=\lambda g_x$, $f_y=\lambda g_y$,  and $g(x,y)=c.$  The coordinates of the optimal ordered pair $(x,y)$ depend on $c$ (because different constraint levels will generally lead to different optimal combinations of $x$ and $y$). Thus, $E=E(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are functions of $c.$ By the chain rule for partial derivatives:   
\[
\frac{d E}{d c}=f_x\frac{d x}{d c}+f_y\frac{d y}{d c}=\text{$\lambda $g}_x\frac{d x}{d c}+\text{$\lambda $g}_y\frac{d y}{d c}=\lambda
\left(\frac{d g}{d c}\right)=\lambda
\]

Maximize $f(x,y)=x y$ subject to $2x+2y=5.$

Let $g(x,y)=2x+2y,$ then we have 
\[
f_x=y, 
\qquad f_y=x, 
\qquad g_x=2,

\qquad g_y=2.
\] 
We need to solve the system 
\[
y=2\lambda, 
\qquad x=2\lambda, 
\qquad \text{and} 
\qquad 2x+2y=5.
\] 
We find $x=y=\frac{5}{4}.$ 
Therefore, $f\left(\frac{5}{4},\frac{5}{4}\right)=\frac{25}{16}$ is the constrained maximum.

\[
2x=\lambda,
\qquad 2y=-2\lambda,

We find that $\lambda =\frac{4}{7}$ and then $x=\frac{2}{7},$ $y=-\frac{4}{7},$ and $z=\frac{6}{7}.$ Therefore, 
\[
f\left(\frac{2}{7}, -\frac{4}{7},\frac{6}{7}\right)=\frac{8}{7}

A rectangular box with no top is to be constructed from 96 $\text{ft}^2$ of material. 
What should be the dimensions of the box if it is to
enclose maximum volume?
::: 
 
::: {.solution }
 Let $x,y,$ and $z$ be the length, width, and height of the rectangular box, respectively. We want to maximize the volume: 
\[
V=x y z \qquad \text{subject to} \qquad  S(x,y,z)=x y+2 x z+2 y z=96
\] 
which is obtained from the surface area of the rectangular box (with no lid). We have 
\[
V_x=y z, 
\quad V_y=x z, 
\quad V_z=x y, 
\quad S_x=y+2 z, 
\quad S_y=x+2 z, 
\quad S_z=2x+2y.
\]
Solve the system 
\[
y z=\lambda (y+2 z), 
\quad x z=\lambda (x+2 z), 
\quad x y=\lambda (2x+2 y), 
\quad x y+2 x z+2 y z=96.
\] 
We obtain $x=y=2 z,$ and then find $x=y=4\sqrt{2},$ $z=2\sqrt{2}.$ Therefore the maximum volume is 
\[
V\left(4\sqrt{2},4\sqrt{2},2\sqrt{2}\right)=64\sqrt{2} \text{ft}^3.

A cylindrical can is to hold $4\pi  \text{in}.^3$ of orange juice. 
The cost per square inch of constructing the metal top and bottom is
twice the cost per square inch of constructing the cardboard side. What are the dimensions of the least expensive can?
::: 

::: {.solution }
 Let $x$ and $y$ be the radius and height of the cylinder, respectively. We want to minimize the cost 
\[
f(x,y)=2\left(2\pi  x^2\right)+2\pi  x y 
\quad \text{subject to the constraint} \quad g(x,y)=\pi  x^2 y=4\pi. 
\] 
We have 
\[
f_x=8\pi  x+2\pi  y, 
\qquad f_y=2\pi  x,
\qquad g_x=2\pi  x y,
\qquad \text{and} 
\qquad g_y=\pi  x^2.
\] 
Solving the system 
\[
8\pi  x+2\pi  y=2\lambda  \pi  x y, 
\qquad 2\pi  x=\lambda  \pi  x^2, 
\qquad \pi  x^2 y=4\pi.
\]  
we obtain $y=4x,$ and then find the radius $x=1$ in. and the height $y=4$ in.

## Optimizing a Function Subject to Two Constraints

The method of Lagrange multipliers can also be applied in situations with more than one constraint equation. Suppose we wish to locate an extremum of a function defined by $f(x,y,z)$ subject to constraints $g(x,y,z)=c_1$ and $h(x,y,z)=c_2,$ where $g$ and $h$ are also differentiable and $\nabla g$ and $\nabla h$ are not parallel. By generalizing Lagrange's theorem, it can be shown that if 
$\left(x_0,y_0,z_0\right)$ is the desired extremum, then there are numbers $\lambda $ and $\mu $ such that 
$g\left(x_0,y_0,z_0\right)=c_1, h\left(x_0,y_0,z_0\right)=c_2,$ 
and
\[
\nabla f\left(x_0,y_0,z_0\right)=\lambda \nabla g\left(x_0,y_0,z_0\right)+\mu \nabla h\left(x_0,y_0,z_0\right).
\]
As in the case of one constraint, we proceed by first solving this system of equations simultaneously to find 
$\lambda , \mu , x_0, y_0, \text{and} z_0$ 
and then evaluating $f(x,y,z)$ at each solution and comparing to find the assumed extremum. 

::: {#exm- } 
Find the maximum value of the function
$$
f(x,y,z)=x+2y+3z
$$ 
on the curve of intersection of the plane $x-y+z=1$ and the cylinder $x^2+y^2=1.$
::: 

::: {.solution }
We maximize the function$f(x,y,z)=x+2y+3z$ 
subject to the constraints $g(x,y,z)=x-y+z=1$ and $h(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2=1.$ 
The Lagrange condition is $\nabla f=\lambda \nabla g+\mu \nabla h,$ so we solve the equations 
\[
1=\lambda +2x \mu,
\quad 2=-\lambda +2, 
\quad  y \mu   3=\lambda, 
\quad  x-y+z=1,  
\quad \text{and} 
\quad  x^2+y^2=1.\]
Putting $\lambda =3,$ we get $2x \mu =-2,$ so $x=-1/\mu .$ Similarly, we have $y=5/(2\mu ).$ Substitution yields 
\[\frac{1}{\mu ^2}+\frac{25}{4\mu^2}=1\]
and so $u^2=\frac{29}{4}.$ Then
\[
\mu =\left.\pm \sqrt{29}\right/2, 
\qquad  x=\mp 2\left/\sqrt{29}\right., 
\qquad \text{and} 
\qquad y=\pm 5\left/\sqrt{29}\right.\]
and so we have $z=1-x+y$ $=1\pm 7\left/\sqrt{29}.\right.$ The corresponding values of $f$ are 
\[
\mp \frac{2}{\sqrt{29}}+2\left(\pm \frac{5}{\sqrt{29}}\right)+3\left(1\pm \frac{7}{\sqrt{29}}\right)=3\pm \sqrt{29}.\]
Therefore the maximum of $f$ on the given curve is $3+\sqrt{29}.$

The solutions are $\left(0,0,\pm\sqrt{3}\right) $, and 
\[
\left(1,\sqrt{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right), \quad 
\left(1,-\sqrt{2},-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right),  \quad
\left(-1,\sqrt{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right), \quad
\left(-1,-\sqrt{2},-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right).

$ f\left(1,\sqrt{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=f\left(1,-\sqrt{2},-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=1.$

Find the minimum of

::: 

::: {.solution }
We want to minimize $x^2+y^2+z^2$ subject to the side conditions 
$x+y-4=0$ and $y+z-6=0.$  We form
\[
L(x,y,z,\lambda ,\mu )=x^2+y^2+z^2-\lambda (x+y-4)-\mu (y+z-6).\]
The conditions are $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}=2x-\lambda =0 $ and
\[
\begin{array}{lll}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial y}=2y-\lambda -\mu =0 
& \qquad \qquad & \frac{\partial L}{\partial z}=2z-\mu =0 \\[12pt]
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda }=x+y-4=0 
& & \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mu }= y+z-6=0. 
\end{array}
\]
The first and third conditions give $\lambda =2x$  and $\mu =2z,$ so the second condition becomes $2y-2x-2z=0.$ We then have 
\[
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
x+ y+z =  0  \\
x+ y  =  4  \\
y+z  =  6
\end{array} \right.
\]
The solution to this system is $P=(2/3,10/3,8/3).$ Therefore the minimum is  $f(P)=56/3.$

The second and third conditions give $\lambda =-2y$ and $\mu =-z,$ so the first condition becomes $2x+2y+z=0.$ We then have $2x+2y+z =0$, $-x+y=-2$, $-x+2z=-4.$  The last two equations may be written as $y=x-2$ and $z=(x-4)/2.$ Substitution of these values into the first equation gives $x=4/3.$ Consequently, $y=-2/3$ and $z=-4/3.$ 
The desired point is therefore, $(4/3,-2/3,-4/3).$

::: {.solution }
Let $g(x,y)=2x^2+3y^2$ and we will use a Lagrange multiplier, say 
$\lambda$. We setup the system of equations  
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\frac{ \partial f}{\partial x} = \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}  
\\[10pt]
\frac{ \partial f}{\partial y} = \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}

\frac{2x y}{x y^2} = 6\lambda  y  \\[10pt]
2x^2+3y^2 = 8
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
\]
Now to solve this we will try to eliminate $\lambda $ from the first two equations. So we solve both of them for $\lambda $ we have,  
$$
\lambda =\frac{1}{4 x^2}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\lambda =\frac{1}{3 x^2 y},
$$
(since $x>0$)  respectively. Thus, these two expressions must equal yielding 
$$
\frac{1}{4 x^2}=\frac{1}{3 x^2 y}
$$ 
we have $4x^2=3x^2y$ which we write as $x^2(4-3y)=0$ and so $y=4/3.$ So that 
\[
x^2=\frac{8-3(4/3)^2}{2}=\frac{4}{3}.\]
However, since $x>0$ we only use $x=\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$ with $y=4/3;$ and therefore the maximum value of $f(x,y)=\ln \left(x y^2\right)$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y)=8$ is 
\[
f\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}},\pm \frac{4}{3}\right)=\ln \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2\right)=\frac{5}{2}\ln \left(\frac{4}{3}\right).
