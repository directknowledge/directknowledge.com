  abstract = {This text in multivariable calculus fosters comprehension through meaningful explanations. Written with students in mathematics, the physical sciences, and engineering in mind, it extends concepts from single variable calculus such as derivative, integral, and important theorems to partial derivatives, multiple integrals, Stokes’ and divergence theorems. Students with a background in single variable calculus are guided through a variety of problem solving techniques and practice problems.}

  abstract = {A half-century ago, advanced calculus was a well-defined subject at the core of the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. Over time, certain aspects of the course came to be seen as more significant—those seen as giving a rigorous foundation to calculus—and they - came the basis for a new course, an introduction to real analysis, that eventually supplanted advanced calculus in the core. Advanced calculus did not, in the process, become less important, but its role in the curriculum changed.}

  publisher={Springer International Publishing},
  abstract = {This textbook focuses on one of the most valuable skills in multivariable and vector calculus: visualization. With over one hundred carefully drawn color images, students who have long struggled picturing, for example, level sets or vector fields will find these abstract concepts rendered with clarity and ingenuity. This illustrative approach to the material covered in standard multivariable and vector calculus textbooks will serve as a much-needed and highly useful companion.}

  abstract = {This vector calculus textbook helps students gain a solid, intuitive understanding of this important subject. The book's careful contemporary balance between theory, application and historical development, provides readers with insights into how mathematics progresses and is in turn influenced by the natural world. The new edition offers a contemporary design, an increased number of practice exercises and content changes based on reviewer feedback, giving this classic text a modern appeal.}

  year={2012},
  publisher={Springer London},
  abstract = {Vector calculus is the fundamental language of mathematical physics. It pro vides a way to describe physical quantities in three-dimensional space and the way in which these quantities vary. Many topics in the physical sciences can be analysed mathematically using the techniques of vector calculus. These top ics include fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electromagnetism, all of which involve a description of vector and scalar quantities in three dimensions. This book assumes no previous knowledge of vectors. However, it is assumed that the reader has a knowledge of basic calculus, including differentiation, integration and partial differentiation. Some knowledge of linear algebra is also required, particularly the concepts of matrices and determinants.}

  publisher={Cambridge University Press},
  abstract ={Gauss's law for electric fields, Gauss's law for magnetic fields, Faraday's law, and the Ampere–Maxwell law are four of the most influential equations in science. In this guide for students, each equation is the subject of an entire chapter, with detailed, plain-language explanations of the physical meaning of each symbol in the equation, for both the integral and differential forms. The final chapter shows how Maxwell's equations may be combined to produce the wave equation, the basis for the electromagnetic theory of light. This book is a wonderful resource for undergraduate and graduate courses in electromagnetism and electromagnetics}
